            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch as it cannot be doubted, but as the Kings most Excellent Maiestie hath taken great contentment in the most duetifull and deuoted affection of his Subiects of this Realme, testified by the vniuersall and ioyfull consent in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Right, and acknowledgement of his Highnesse for their Souereigne; so on the other side, his Maiesties Subiects will finde much ioy and comfort by receiuing knowledge of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and louing acceptance of their said most humble and most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate seruice and duetie: It is therefore very meet, That (his Maiestie hauing of late, by his seuerall Letters of the eight and twentieth, and of the last of March, vnto such of vs the Nobilitie of this Realme, and others that were of the late Queenes Priuy Counsel, as are here at his Highnesse Pallace of <hi>Whitehall</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the seruice of his Maiestie and the State, signified his gracious acceptance, and Princely thankefulnesse vnto all his

And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that we should declare and make knowen his Maiesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure deliuered likewise in the said Letters, touching the necessary continuation (during his absence, or vntill it shall please his Highnesse to giue other commandement and direction) of such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and proceedings for the preseruation of Peace, administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iustice, and gouernment of the State, as were formerly established, &amp; stood in force immediatly before the late Queenes deceasse, which chiefly, and in effect is this: That whereas vpon the deceasse of the late Queenes Maiestie, the authority of the most part of the Officers and places of Iurisdiction and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within this Realme, &amp; in the Realme of Ireland, did cease and faile, the Souereigne person failing from whom the same were deriued, and thereupon through doubtfulnesse, and want of authority for execution, in such persons as were inuested in the sayd Offices and places, the setled and ordinary course of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the State (if remedy were not prouided) might receiue disturbance and preiudice by discontinuance and interruption: His Maiestie in his Princely wisedome, and care of the State (reseruing vnto his owne iudgement hereafter the reformation and redresse of any abuses in misgouernment vpon better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge taken therof, in his due time) is pleased, and hath so expresly signified, That all persons, that at the time of the late Queenes Maiesties deceasse, were duely and lawfully possessed of any place or Office of authority, iurisdiction, or gouernment, either Ciuill or Martiall within this Realme, or in the Realme of Ireland, And namely, all Lieutenants, Sheriffes, deputy Lieutenants, Commissioners of Musters, Iustices of the Peace, and all others in place of Gouernment, either meaner or superiour, (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) shal be, and shall so hold themselues continued in the sayd place and Offices, as formerly they held and enioyed the same, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his Maiesties pleasure bee further knowen. And that in the meane while (for the preseruation of Peace, and necessary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in matters of Iustice, and for safety of the State) all the said persons, of whatsoeuer degree or condition may not faile, euery one seuerally according to his place, office, or charge, to proceed in the performance and execution of all dueties thereto belonging, as formerly appertained to them and euery of them, while the late Queenes Maiesty was liuing.</p>
               <p>And albeit the earnest and longing desire in all his Maiesties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177081:8"/> Subiects, to enioy the sight of his Royall person and presence (which hath mooued very many of good degree and quality, and some of them hauing place of charge in the Countrey where they dwell, to hasten and take their iourneys at this time vnto his highnesse) be, for it selfe, commendable in them, and acceptable to his Maiesty, being an argument of their abundant ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Neuerthelesse, because the ouer-much, and too frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort and concourse of people in those parts where his Maiesty as yet remayneth, or which are farre distant from the heart of this Realme, is at this present inconuenient, and may prooue more dangerous, both in respect that the Countrey whither such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary resort is made, shall be ouercharged with multitude, and therof scarcity &amp; dearth is like ynough to proceed, and also because these more inward parts of the Realme shal in the meane while be impayred in hospitality, and being destitute of such assistance as is needfull, it may be doubted to what danger or disturbance, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne or domesticall, they may be exposed: His Maiesty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his wisedome both gratiously accepting the good will of his Subiects, and withall regarding what is conuenient for his seruice, and for the securitie of the State at this time is pleased, and doth require, That such concourse and resort into those parts be forborne, and aboue all others, of those persons that haue any place of charge or office, either on the Seacoast or the In-land, or are of good degree and quality in their Countrey: And that such orderly course be hereafter holden (in the discretion of all such persons as aforesayd) for repaire and resort to his Highnesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at his comming into this Realme, as may conueniently stand and agree with the care and seruice necessarily belonging, and to be performed in all parts of the Realme, to his Highnesse and the State, His Maiesty being no lesse graciously disposed, and willing (in all conuenient sort) to giue contentment and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to his owne eyes and minde, by the sight of his most loyall and louing Subiects, then they are infinitely desirous to enioy the happinesse of his Maiesties person and presence, who (we doubt not) long before this time is already safe in this his Realme of England, though his Maiesty forbeareth to come presently to his City of London, vntill those things can bee set in readinesse, which are fit and honourable for the reception of so great and mighty a King.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation inhibiting the vse and execution of any Charter or Grant made by the late Queene Elizabeth, of any kinde of Monopolies. &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe Zeale and great affection, which we haue found in all sorts of people of this our Kingdom towards our Person, and that Right which wee had to the succession of this Crowne, hath so many wayes bene expressed, as we cannot chuse but make it manifest to them all by some publike declaration, how great a desire it hath wrought in our heart to shew our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptation of their deuotion towards vs, whensoeuer there shall be offered either occasion or subiect, that may concerne their vniuersall good. For though it be true, that our Right was so assured, that whatsoeuer testimonie could thereof be vttered, was but the duetie of Subiects, acknowledging that faith and loyaltie whereunto by the Lawes of God and Nature they were bound: yet doe we confesse, that there is in the true rules of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice from the Soueraigne to the Subiect, a reciprocall office and respect, which they are bound in honour and cÅscience to obserue. The consideration whereof, hath mooued vs to thinke of such wayes, as for the present did occurre vnto vs, wherein we might make manifest to our people, how willing we are now, and will be ready hereafter, to bee as forward in requiting their loue, as they haue bene in expressing it. In which consideration while we were busied, we were informed that the Queene our sister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, finding some few yeeres before her death, that some things had passed her hand at the importunity of her seruants, whom she was willing to reward with little burden to her estate (otherwise by necessary occasions exhausted,) which though they had and might haue foundation in Princely prerogatiue, yet either by too large extending thereof, or for the most part in respect that they were of such nature, as could hardly be put in vse without hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to multitudes of people, or els committed to inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who in the execution thereof did so exceedingly abuse the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177081:12"/> same, as they became intollerable: Had purposed to reuoke all Grants of that nature, and did begin with some, which were held most vniust, putting the rest to the examination of her Lawes to stand or fall, as in the construction of Law they might consist, or not. We, who though we had neuer had such an example, were euer opposite in our owne nature to any thing that had colour of oppression, hold it our part not onely carefully to perfect all her good intentions, but to study further by all good meanes, and with all expedition to put in practise all other courses whereby a people so louing, so duetifull, and so deare vnto vs, may know and feele that we are as desirous to make them happy by our Iustice and grace towards them in all reasonable things, as they haue bene ready to increase our comfort and contentment in yeelding their loyalty and obedience towards our establishment in those Rights, which vnder God we doe enioy. Therefore we doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly charge and command all persons whatsoeuer, That from hencefoorth they vtterly desist and forbeare to vse or execute any maner of Charter or Grant made by our late Sister the Queene deceased, of any kinde of Monopolies, or of any power or Licence to dispence with, or discharge any maner of penall Lawes (except such Grants onely, as haue bene made to any Corporation or Company of any Art or Mysterie, or for the maintenance or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of any trade of merchandize) vntill such time as the same Charter or Grant shalbe examined and allowed of by vs, with the aduise of our Counsell, to be fit to be put in execution, without any preiudice to our louing Subiects. And where here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore many haue bene greatly preiudiced and delayed in suing for their debts &amp; other dueties by sundry kind of Protections, and by pretence of other Priuiledges and exemptions: We charge and command, and our expresse will and pleasure is, That no Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Priuiledge or exemption to delay any persons Suiterr Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall from hencefoorth bee receiued or allowed in any our Courts or els where, which are or shalbe contrary or repugnant to the Lawes of this Realme.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, we wil and command, that no assignements of Debts or Actions be made vnto vs by any that is, or pretendeth to bee indebted vnto vs, who is otherwise able and sufficient by himselfe, or by his Sureties, readily to pay the same Debt, nor any assignment taken to our vse of any Debt, other then such, as shall then appeare to be a iust and true Debt. And for that we are certainely informed of many great disorders and abuses, to the great griefe of our louing Subiects as well by Salt-petermen and such as haue or pretend to haue Commission and Authority
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177081:13"/> to make Salt-peter, as also by sundry Purueyors and Takers of Carts and other prouisions for our vse and seruice: Therefore we do expresly charge and command, that the sayd Salt-petermen, Purueyors and Takers, haue especiall care to execute their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Authorities without any maner of oppression, grieuance or wrong to be done to any our louing Subiects. And if they that haue the Commissions, shal abuse the execution of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this our declaration, We are pleased that such, as shal be grieued therewith, shall resort to vs or our Councell with their complaints. And we doe also giue expresse charge and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to al Lawyers, Atturneys, Officers and Clearkes, of and in any our Courts of Iustice whatsoeuer, Ecclesiasticall or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, that they nor any of them extort or take any vndue or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue Fees, but such onely as are allowed to be had or taken in the same Courts. And to the end that our pleasure and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement may be duely and effectually performed, and obserued in the premisses: We doe hereby notifie and declare, that whosoeuer shall presume to breake or violate in any thing aforesaid our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all commandements, they shall thereby incurre our indignation and displeasure, And that vpon complaint and proofe thereof made, wee will not faile to proceed to such seuere punishment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such offenders according to their demerits, as shalbe fit for so high and contemptuous an offence. These graces aboue spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, as we doe presently extend to our people, and doe intend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hereafter when wee shall vnderstand more particularly wherein we may yeeld them comfort: So because things well meant may in the maner of the execution of them be abused; and Complaints grounded vpon iust causes, may in the crauing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy be accompanied with offensiue proceedings, Wee haue thought good to admonish our Subiects, that we doe expect at their hands, that if in the things aboue specified, or in any other wherewith they shall finde themselues grieued (which haue not yet come to our knowledge) they shall haue cause to seeke any thing at our handes, they shall forbeare all assembling and flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in multitudes, but shall in lawful and decent maner without numbers, without clamor, or any other kind of disorder, resort to vs or our Councell by way of humble Petition; from whom they shall receiue such answere, as shall make manifest the zeale we haue to the obseruation of Iustice, and maintenance of their welfare, if their Complaints be iust. And on the other side, if we shall perceiue that their petitions shal sauour of humor, and tend onely to slander and calumniation, and indeed haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation, but such as often happeneth in vulgar people,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:177081:13"/> vnder pretence of seeking publique redresses to vtter priuate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: We would haue them vnderstand hereby, that they shall not onely displease vs therein, but finde that we hold it no lesse the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Prince to protect their Magistrates and Officers, and all publique persons in their iust causes, then to giue redresse to the vulgar sort, when they haue in deed cause to complaine, against all persons how great soeuer they be in rule or dignitie vnder vs: Reseruing to our selfe the Right iustly appertayning to our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, for that we would not haue it conceiued, that in doing these things out of our Grace, we doe intend to renounce those ancient dueties and Priuiledges, which haue descended vpon vs with the succession of our Kingdomes. And for that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that there hath bene heretofore great neglect in this kingdome of keeping the Sabbath day: For better obseruing of the same, and auoyding of all impious prophanation of it, we doe straitly charge and command, that no Beare-bayting, Bul-bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Enterludes, Common Playes, or other like disordered or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Exercises or Pastimes be frequented, kept or vsed, at any time hereafter vpon any Sabbath day.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177081:15"/> they are encouraged by the receipt and harbour granted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, their wiues, children, goods and geir in the Inland and peaceable parts of both the Realmes, highly to his Maiesties contempt, and frustrating of his Highnesse Commission granted to the effect aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And therefore his Maiesty for the better satisfaction of all his good Subiects, who may stand in any doubt of the sayd Vnion, and to take away all pretence of excuse from wicked and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent persons, hath hereby thought good to publish and make knowen to all those to whose knowledge these Presents shall come, That as his Maiestie hath found in the hearts of all the best disposed Subiects of both the Realmes of al qualities, a most earnest desire, that the sayd happy Vnion should be perfected, the memory of all preterite discontentments abolished, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of both the Realmes to be the Subiects of one kingdome: so his Highnesse will with all conuenient diligence with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Estates and Parliament of both the kingdomes make the same to be perfited. And in the meane time till the sayd Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be established with the due solemnitie aforesaid, his Maiestie doeth hereby repute, hold, and esteeme, and commands all his Highnesse Subiects to repute, holde, and esteeme both the two Realmes as presently vnited, and as one Realme and kingdome, and the Subiects of both the Realmes as one people, brethren and members of one body: And in regard thereof, that euery one of them abstaine and forbeare to commit any kinde of robbery, bloodshed, or any other insolence or disorder, or to receiue and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the persons, wiues, children or goods of the fugitiues and Outlawes of either of the Realmes, but to conteine themselues in peace and quietnesse, and all such duetifull behauiour as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth good and loyall Subiects, certifying all and euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who shall doe, practise, or attempt any thing to the violating of these Presents, that they shall incurre the punishment due to the sayd Rebels, and that the same shalbe executed against them with all rigor and extremity to the terror of others.</p>

               <p>AT our first entrance into this our Realme, and in all the way as we haue passed, we tooke no small contentment in the resort of Noblemen, Gentlemen and other our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects comming to visit vs, holding their affectionate desire to see our Person, to be a certaine testimonie of their inward loue. And in the same contentment we haue dwelled since our soiourning at this place, and shall euer remaine, as long as such concourse of them to our Court may bee without grieuance and offence to the Body of this Realme. But hearing from all parts of our Kingdome, that by the remooue of great numbers of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Gentlemen out of the seuerall Counties, aswell of such as haue charge there, as Deputie Lieutenants, or Commissioners for the Musters or for the peace, as others with their whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, both th'excution of things incident to their charge is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and Hospitalitie exceedingly decayed, whereby the reliefe of the poorer sort of people is taken away, who had from such houses much comfort and ease towards their liuing: For reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the inconueniences like to grow thereby, and also for that we finde the sickenesse already somewhat forward within our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of London, which by concourse of people abiding there is very like to be increased, and importeth vs aswell for our peoples sake, as for the safetie of our owne Person (who for the most part liue in places neere the said Citie) to preuent by all prouident meanes: We haue bene moued rather to want for a time the contentment we haue in the sight and resort of our Subiects to vs, then for our owne priuate delight, to giue way to so great a mischiefe, as the continuall resort hither may breed. Wherefore wee doe hereby will and command all Gentlemen and others, aswell such as haue any kind of charge in the Counties of their ordinarie habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as of other sort, That if they haue not some speciall cause of attendance at our Court for our Seruice, or for some necessary cause concerning their owne estate, whereof they may informe our Priuie Councell, they shall immediatly after the ende of this Terme depart our said Citie of London and the Suburbs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and returne to their seuerall habitations in the Counties of their abode, vntill the time of our Coronation bee come, at what time we shall not mislike to haue them returne vntill that solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie be passed. And because we perceiue that heretofore there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177081:16"/> hath bene a great neglect in obeying Proclamations published vpon iust causes, we doe admonish all those whom this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerneth, to be so wary, as we haue not iust cause to make them an example of contempt, which we must and will doe, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Terme ended we shall finde any making stay here, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this direction.</p>

               <p>WHere in a Proclamation (lately by vs published) for considerations therein expressed, Wee prescribed a course whereby the complaints of our people might be taken away, if the same should appeare to be iustly grounded; Hauing now since that time receiued particular information, that a Grant to certaine Patentees for the sole preemption of Tinne, was very inconuenient and full of grieuance to our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Subiects: Wee, after long debate thereof before our selfe and our Priuie Councell, where obiections of either side were made, and where the inconueniences were layed open, Haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued not onely to consider how the generalitie of our Subiects might be relieued in suspension of this Grant, but how the same might be done without any iniustice to any particuler person, who is interessed therein by vertue of Letters Patents vnder the great Seale of England, whereof we neuer intend to seeke any course of reuocation, but by an ordinary course of Iustice, in which all our people are equally interessed.

               <p>WHereas for the auoyding of variety and deceits of Weights &amp; Measures, diuers Statutes, Acts and good Ordinances haue heretofore bene made, That one Weight, and one Measure should bee vsed throughout the Realme, And where, according to the Statutes made in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth and twelfth yeres of the reigne of the late King of famous memory King Henry the seuenth, there were made, sent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into diuers Cities and Townes, specified in a Schedule vnto the sayd Act of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. annexed, Weights and Measures of brasse according to the Standards thereof remaining in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of the Exchequer, to remaine in the keeping of the Maior, Bayliffe, or other head Officer for the time being, of euery of the same City or Towne, as the Kings Standard of Weight and Measure, with authority and power giuen by the same Statute, to the sayd Maior, Bailiffe, or other head Officer, hauing the said Waights and Measures, to make, signe and print like Weights and Measures vnto euery of the Kings Subiects, duely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same, as by the sayd Statutes more at large appeareth: And whereas also our late Soueraigne Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> late Queene of England, being enformed that the sayd Standard measures remayning in those Cities and Townes, for the most part were by long continuance of time, or for want of good kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or other defects or abuses, differing and not agreeing with the ancient Standard or Measures remayning in her highnesse Exchequer at Westminster, by occasion whereof the Measures commonly vsed within the Realme were vncertaine, and vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from another, to the great slander of the same, the disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Subiects, and the deceyuing of many both buyers and sellers, Did giue order and commandement to the L. Treasurer and vnder Treasurer, to cause all the ancient Standard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of all those seuerall Cities and Townes to bee brought in before them at the Exchequer at Westminster, to be examined and tried by the Standard measure there remayning, according to which her Maiesties commandement, the Lord Treasurer and vnder Treasurer haue caused al the ancient Standard measures of all those seueral Cities and Townes to be brought before them into the sayd Exchequer, where diuers of them vpon diligent and due triall and examination haue bene found defectiue, differing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177081:21"/> and disagreeing from the true and ancient Standard of the said Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the sayd late Queene intending the common and publique good of all her louing Subiects, and to auoyd all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and deceits of Measure within her highnesse Realme, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good and deliberate aduise, and due consideration therein had, Did not onely establish the foresayd true and ancient Standard of Measures remayning in the said Exchequer, there to continue and be, as her Maiesties Standard, to examine, try, and size all other Measures of the Realme by, from time to time as occasion shall require: But also did giue commandement to the L. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer &amp; vnder Treasurer, to cause all the other Measures which were brought before them (from the Cities and Townes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) found vpon triall to be differing and disagreeing from the true and ancient Standards of measures of the sayd Exchequer, to be broken.</p>
               <p>And further her Maiesty did giue order and commandement vnto the sayd Lord Treasurer and vnder Treasurer, foorthwith to cause new Standards of measures in Brasse to be made, tried, and approoued by the said true and ancient Standard of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and after true and iust examination and triall thereof had and made, to size and Seale (with the letter <hi>E.</hi> crowned) such and so many Standard measures, for euery of the sayd seuerall Cities and Townes limitted to haue the custody of Weights and measures, according to the Queenes Standard for euery Shire by the sayd schedule annexed vnto the sayd Statute made in the eleuenth yeere of the reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, there to remaine for euer in the keeping of the Maior, Bayliffe, or other head Officer for the time being of the said City and Towne as her Standard of measure, as to them should seeme necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. And also as many as may serue and be conuenient for the Clarke of the Market of her highnesse houshold (and through the Realme) or his Deputies, according to the Statute of <hi>Anno</hi> 16. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. And also as might or should serue for any other her Maiesties Officers or Subiects within this Realme as should make suite for the hauing and obtayning of the same.</p>
               <p>And now our Soueraigne Lord the Kings Maiestie, minding likewise the quietnes and publike good of all his louing subiects, and for the right and iust maintenance, and execution of all those good and godly Lawes in that behalfe heretofore made by his most noble Progenitors, to be daily vsed and put in execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all his said Subiects of this his Highnesse Realme of England, aswell within Liberties as without; His Maiesties

And shall also make, signe, and print with the first letter of the name of the same City, Borough, Towne, or place where the same shall be so made, sized, and printed, like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures vnto euery of the Kings subiects duely requiring the same, taking such fees for the doing thereof as by the Statutes of the Realme are allowed, and no more. And euery of the said Maiors, Bayliffes, &amp; other head Officers of Cities, Boroughs, Townes, and places within this Realme, shall further doe and cause to bee done, all such other Acte and Actes, thing and things, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding, hauing, and vsing of the sayd Standards of Measures, as be limitted and appoynted to their or any of their authority by the said Statutes made in the eleuenth and twelfth yeeres of the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, or any other Statute or Ordinance whatsoeuer: So as al the Measures through the Realme may be reformed and made agreeable according to the Standard of the Exchequer, as by the sayd Statutes in such case is required. And his Maiesty further straitly chargeth and commandeth, That no person or persons shall from the aforesayd feast of S. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew next comming, vse any other Measure or Measures, but such as shalbe made or sized, and respectiuely agreeing with the sayd Standards, and printed and marked with the letter <hi>I.</hi> crowned, with such markes and letters for euery towne as before is limitted, vpon paine to be apprehended, committed to prison, fined and punished, as contriuers and vsers of false Measures,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177081:22"/> according to the Statutes in that case made and prouided. And that this Proclamation for the better instructing of all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Subiects, shall before the feast of <hi>All Saints</hi> now next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, be proclaimed in euery Market towne thorow the Realme, and be hanged vp, and fastened in a Table in the Market place by an Officer, where it may continue to be seene and read by any that will. And that the defaults of Officers, of euery towne in this behalfe, shall be enquired of and punished by the Iustices of Assise, and Iustices of Peace in their Sessions, according to their discretions, as contemners of his Maiesties commaundement. And that all the Standards and measures whatsoeuer, not sized, marked and printed, and made respectiuely agreeing to and with the foresaid Standard, and the true meaning of this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shall from the sayd feast of <hi>All Saints</hi> next comming, which shalbe in the yeere of our Lord God 1603. be reputed and taken for vntrue Measures, and shalbe broken, defaced and destroyed by the owners of the same, or by such officers as haue or shall haue authority to enquire of false Weights and measures.</p>
               <p>And for the better execution hereof, his highnesse expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is, That all Maiors, Bayliffes, and other head offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of euery City, Shire, Towne, Borough or Market within this Realme, shall immediatly after the said feast of <hi>All Saints,</hi> and so from time to time according to the sayd Statute, as all other Corporate, Borough, or Market Townes within this Realme, cause to be brought before them all the Measures, within the same Cities, Boroughs, Corporate or Market Townes, to bee duely viewed and examined, and such as they shall finde defectiue or disagreeing vnto the foresayd Standard measures, either in greatnesse or smalnesse, to cause to be broken and defaced, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther punishment to be done vpon the offenders therein, according to the Statute. And that the Iustices of Peace, or two of them (whereof one of them to be of the <hi>Quorum</hi>) shall with all diligence and from time to time, by examination or enquirie heare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the defaults of all Maiors, Bayliffes, and other head Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Cities, Boroughs, Corporate or Market Townes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their limits or authorities on that behalfe, and to set Fines and Amercements vpon the offenders in that behalfe by their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and those to estreat into the Court of Exchequer, and that vpon paine of the punishment due for such contempt.</p>
               <p>And lastly, his Maiesty straitly chargeth and commandeth all Iustices of Assize, Iustices of Peace, his highnesse Clarke of the Market, his deputie or deputies, Maiors, Bayliffes, Stewards of Liberties, and all other his Maiesties Officers and ministers

               <p>FOrasmuch as we finde that the infection within our City of London doeth dayly increase, and is like (to our griefe) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to augment then to diminish, aswel by reason of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the yeere, as by the great Concourse of people to our sayd Citie against the time of our Coronation, some to doe their duties in such necessarie seruices, as to them belongeth at that solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and some for comfort they take in the sight of our Person, of the Queene our deare wife, and of our children; Although there could be no greater ioy to vs then the presence and confluence of all sorts of good Subiects at such a time, when the more there should be partakers of that publike reioycing, the more should bee our particular comfort: yet such is our feare lest this their resort should worke a contrary effect both to their and our expectation, namely to be a meanes not onely of increasing the infection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Citie, but of dispersing it into all places of this Realme, as we had rather forbeare some part of our ornament and custome, which is due to the honour and solemnitie of our Coronation, then by hauing the vttermost thereof perfourmed, be the occasion of so great an euill to our people, as is the spreading of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amongst them,</p>

               <p>WEe haue since our entry into this Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had speciall care to make all our Subiects know, with how equall affection we resolued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all things which should concerne the safety or honour of our Kingdomes, for both which we know we are to make one and the selfe-same accompt to Almighty God, vnder whom wee hold all earthly things; In which respect, we were very curious to preuent at our first comming all maner of offences or affronts, which naturally do arise betweene seuerall Nations at their first ioyning in society and conuersation, neuer ceasing to lay seuere commandement vpon our greatest Subiects that came in with vs, to suppresse any iniurious Actions of any of their Seruants or traine, towards the meanest subiect of English birth, in whom from the highest to the lowest we haue obserued so great loue and generall obedience to vs and our commandements: And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it hath come to our eares that any offence hath bene done by any of them, We haue made them know how much it hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased vs. Notwithstanding, because we doe heare of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177081:23"/> reported to be committed by our Nation of Scotland to our English Subiects, with this addition further, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Iustices are thought to be remisse towards such, in doubt lest the same should be offensiuely reported to vs: We haue thought it conuenient aswel for the satisfaction of the one sort, as for admonition to the others, to publish by open signification, That seeing it hath pleased Almighty God to call vs to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power ouer both, We are purposed to be an vniuersall and equal Souereigne to them both, and to administer Iustice where there shall be occasion, without any worldly respect to either of them. And therefore do hereby enioyne all Lieutenants, Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lieutenants, Iustices of Peace, and all other our Officers and ministers of this kingdome, that whensoeuer complaint shall be made to any of them, that breach of Peace is committed by those of our nation of Scotland, vpon the Subiects of England, or by the Subiects of England vpon those of the nation of Scotland, In both which kindes wee heare of many great abuses, though sometimes aggrauated according to the humour of the repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they shall carefully vpon euery complaint, examine with all indifferencie the particulars of euery such Action, and cause pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be inflicted vpon the party offending, without respect of nation, according to the Lawes of this Realme.</p>
               <p>And to the end they may not doubt to proceed to the execution thereof: As we doe hereby not onely assure them that wee will strengthen and maintaine all Officers and Magistrates in the execution of their Offices, for the preseruation of the publike Peace of this Realme: So if we shall see at any time that any Magistrate shalbe slow to redresse such grieuances, or punish the Offenders, We shall haue cause to thinke, that they are willing to nourish some cause of such rumors, the rather to serue for colour or cause of further alienation, and so by consequence of sedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our people, &amp; an hinderance to that Vnion betweene both States, which is one of the greatest benefits that we bring with vs to our people for their strength and safety; in gouerning of whom, though we must vse, as all other Princes doe, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of subordinate Ministers, yet God Almighty knoweth, that in our owne minde there is not a thought of partialitie towards either of them, but an internall desire and resolution to affoord indifferent grace and Iustice to all: For demonstration whereof we haue bene forced to publish thus much, lest the iniquitie of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vnruly spirits might blemish the innocencie and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of our heart towardes all our Subiects, whom wee hold dearer then our owne life.</p>

               <p>THe Solemnities of our Coronation being now performed according to the vsages and customes of this our Realme of England, and with mutuall contentment, aswell of Vs in the zeale and loue of our people at the performance thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as of them in the expectation of our gouernment; Wee haue entred into consideration of the state of the seuerall parts of the body of our Realme, and therein doe finde, that the absence of the Noblemen and Gentlemen which are vsed to reside there in seuerall quarters, is accompanied with great inconuenience, as well in the want of reliefe which the poorer sort did receiue by their ordinary Hospitality, as also chiefly in the defect of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby besides other inconueniences, through lacke of order, the infection of the plague spreadeth and scattereth it selfe into diuers places of the Realme, and is like further to increase, if by the presence and care of such as are in authority and credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our people, they be not contained in some good course, for the preuenting of that contagion.</p>
               <p>Wherfore hauing taken order for the returning home into their Countreys of diuers of the Nobility of our Nation of Scotland, and others also, who to doe vs honour at our Coronation, haue attended here since the entring of Vs and the Queene our deare wife into this Kingdome: We haue thought good also to publish to all other good Subiects of this Realme, that our pleasure is, and wee command that all such as are not our seruants in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or be not bound to attendance about our Court by expresse

               <p>THe spreading of the infection in our City of London, and in the places next about it, doeth giue vs iust cause to be as prouident as a carefull Prince can be, to take away all occasion of increasing the same. And if such directions as we gaue, and our Councell, at our first approching to the City, had bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, it is like that (with Gods fauour) the sicknesse had neither growen to that height, nor spread so farre as now it is. But that hauing bene omitted by the negligence of such whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to haue had it performed, The same care of our peoples welfare mooueth vs as much as we may, to prouide for the time to come. And forasmuch as there are at hand two notable Faires, vnto which there is vsually extraordinary resort out of all parts of the kingdome, one in Smithfield neere our City of London, commonly called <hi>Bartlemew Faire,</hi> and the other neere Cambridge commonly called <hi>Sturbridge Faire,</hi> which if they should be held at the vsuall times, would in all likelyhood be the occasion both of the increase, and of dispersing of the contagion into all the parts of our Realme: Wee haue thought good by open declaration of our pleasure, not onely to admonish, and to require all our louing Subiects, to forbeare to resort at this time to any of the sayd two Faires, of <hi>Bartlemew</hi> neere London, and of <hi>Sturbridge,</hi> but also to enioyne to the Lords of the said Faires, and others interessed therein, and of all other Faires within fifty miles of our City of London, that they shal not hold the said Faires, nor any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to them, at the times accustomed, nor any time till they shall be licensed by vs, vpon paine of such punishment, as for a contempt so much concerning the vniuersall safety of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they shall be adiudged to deserue, Which they shall be assured that we will cause to be inflicted vpon them with all seuerity. For such is our desire to preuent an vniuersall contagion among our people, which this infection threatneth, as we will not spare any one who shalbe cause of dispersing such an euil among them. And we do further charge and enioyne vnder like penaltie, to all Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and inhabitants of our City of London, that none of them shall repaire to any Faires held within any part of this Realme, vntill it shall please God to cease the infection now reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177081:28"/> particularly mentioned and set downe, more at large appeareth: His Maiestie purposing (for the vniuersall good of the whole Realme) to haue the same Law duely and fully execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doeth by aduise of his Priuie Councell require all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Bailiffes, Hedboroughs, Constables, and other Officers whatsoeuer to whom it appertaineth, to see that the said Law be in all the parts, and branches of the same carefully, duely and exactly executed, as they and euery of them will answere the contrary at their vttermost perils.</p>

               <p>THe Kings Maiestie being certainly enformed through the manifold and dayly complaints made to his highnesse, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by his owne Subiects as others, of the continuall Depredations, and Piracies committed on the Seas by certaine lewd and ill disposed persons; and finding that the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings held of late times for the suppressing of these enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offences, haue wrought lesse reformation then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected: In his Princely care to preserue Iustice, as one of the maine pillars of his Estate, and for the speedier suppressing of all such Piracies and Depredacious crimes, most hatefull to his minde, and scandalous to his peaceable gouernment, and for the better continuance of amitie with all other Princes and States; Hath with the aduise of his Priuie Counsell, for the speedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention or seuere punishment hereafter of such fowle crimes and Piracies, Set downe certaine Articles hereunto annexed, which his highnesse commandeth all his Officers whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, of what degree soeuer, to see duely executed, Wherein if any maner of person shalbe found culpable or wilfully negligent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous, or disobedient, His Maiestie declareth hereby, that punishment shalbe inflicted vpon him or them with such seuerity, as the example thereof shall terrifie all others from committing any so odious crimes, or contemptuous offences.</p>
               <p>FIrst, that no man of Warre be furnished or set out to Sea by any of his Maiesties Subiects, vnder paine of death and confiscation of Lands and goods, not onely to the Captaines and Mariners, but also to the owners &amp; Victuallers, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the said ship shall commit any Piracie, Depredation or murther at the Sea, vpon any of his Maiesties friends.</p>
               <p>Item, that if any porson whatsoeuer shall vpon the Seas take any Ship that doeth belong to any of his Maiesties friends and Allies, or to any of their Subiects, or shall take out of it by force any goods of what nature or qualitie soeuer, he or they so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding shall suffer death, with confiscation of Lands and goods, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law in that case prouided.</p>
               <p>Item, that all Admirall causes (except the causes now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the Commissioners for causes of Depredations) shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be summarily heard by the Iudge of the high Court of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie, without admitting any vnnecessary delay.</p>

               <p>Item, that no appeale from him be admitted to the defendant or defendants in causes of Depredation, either against the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or their accessaries, before or after the offence committed, or those in whose possession the goods spoyled are found, Vnlesse first by way of prouision, the summe adiudged be payd to the plaintife vpon Sureties to repay it, if the Sentence shalbe reuersed.</p>
               <p>Item, that no prohibition in such cases of spoile and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries or dependances be granted hereafter.</p>
               <p>Item, that no ship or goods taken from any his Maiesties friends, shall bee deliuered by any other order then vpon proofe made in the said Court of the Admiraltie, before the said Iudge or his deputie, to the end that a Record may be kept of all such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions made to strangers, to serue when occasion shal require.</p>
               <p>Item, that euery Viceadmirall is enioyned by this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whereof he shall take notice at his perill) to certifie into the sayd Court of the Admiralty euery quarter of the yere what man of Warre hath gone to the Sea, or returned home within that time, with any goods taken at Sea, or the procedue thereof, vpon paine to lose to his Maiestie (by way of Fine) for euery such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault forty pounds of currant money of England, to be answered into his Maiesties Receipt of the Exchequer, by Certificate from the said Iudge of the Admiralty vnder the great Seale of that Office, to bee directed to the Lord Treasurer and the Barons of the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Item, that all the Kings Subiects shall forbeare from ayding or receiuing of any Pirate or Sea-rouer, or any person not being a knowen Merchant, by contracting, buying, selling or exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, or by victualling of them or any of their company, whereby they or any of them shalbe the more enabled to goe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Seas to commit any Piracie or disorder, vpon paine for so doing to be punished presently, as the principall offendors and Pirats ought to be.</p>

For if there shalbe any maner of suspicion that the said person, though he shall pretend to trade for Merchandize or Fishing, hath, or may haue an intent by his prouisions or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, otherwise then to vse the trade of Merchandize or fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in such case of suspicion the Officers of the Ports shall stay, and in no wise suffer the same to passe to the Seas without

And if the said Officers shall suffer any person otherwise to repaire to the Seas then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue is mentioned, they shall not onely answere for any Piracies which any such person shall chance hereafter to doe vpon the Seas, but shall suffer imprisonment vntill the offendours may bee apprehended, if they shall bee liuing. And generally his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie declareth and denounceth all such Pirats and Rouers vpon the Seas to be out of his Maiesties Protection, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to bee by any person taken, punished, and suppressed with extremitie.</p>
               <p>And whereas diuers great and enormous spoiles and Piracies haue bene of late time committed within the Straits of <hi>Gyblaltar</hi> by Captaine <hi>Thomas Tomkins</hi> gentleman, <hi>Edmond Bonham, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ianuerin,</hi> Mariners, and diuers other English Pirats, and the goods, moneyes and Merchandizes brought into England by them, haue bene scattered, solde, and disposed of most lewdly and prodigally, by the meanes of their Receiuers, comforters &amp; abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to the exceeding preiudice of his Maiesties good friends the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom they haue robbed, and to the great displeasure of God, and dishonour of this State: His Maiestie doeth expresly command al Lieutenants, deputy Lieutenants, Admirals, Vice-admirals and their deputies, and all other Officers of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and al Iustices of the Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bailiffes, Constables, and all other his Officers and ministers whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to vse all care and diligence in the inquiring, searching for, and apprehending of all such Pirats, their receiuers, comforters, and abettors.

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iournement of part of Michaelmas Terme from Westminster to Winchester.</head>
               <p>WHereas the Kings most excellent Maiestie, vpon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation giuen to his Highnesse of the infection of the plague growen &amp; dispersed in his cities of London and Westminster, did by his proclamation dated at his Mannor of Woodstock the sixteenth day of September last past, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations therein expressed, cause the Terme of S. Michael to be adiourned vnto the fourth Returne thereof, commonly called <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> Hoping by that time, through the goodnesse of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and such orders as by his Maiesties especiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement were appointed to be kept and obserued, and by the coldnes of the aire, the saide infection of the plague might haue bene so much diminished, as that the residue of the Terme might, without danger to his louing subiects, which his Maiesty great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desireth, haue bene continued at Westminster: Forasmuch as his Maiestie hath since receiued knowledge, by Certificates sent from London and Westminster, that the plague still continueth, and therefore doubteth that if the saide Terme should bee kept at Westminster from the said <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> it could not bee but dangerous to such his louing subiects, who for Suits and other causes should make their necessary repaire thither; Therefore vpon the considerations aforesaid, his Maiesty hath by aduice of his Highnes Councell, thought it very expedient, that the Terme should be adiourned from the said Returne commonly called <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se Michaelis,</hi> vntill the Returne commonly called <hi>Crastino Sancti Martini</hi> next ensuing, and thereby the rest of the vsuall Terme to be continued and kept, for which purpose especiall choise is made of his Maiesties Citie of Winchester, in his County of Southam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton, and at which place his Maiesties pleasure is, that now the residue of the Terme shall bee kept: doeth therefore declare, and hereby signifie his will and pleasure, that Writs of Adiournment shall be directed to the Iustices of either Bench, and to the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all other his Maiesties Courts to whome like Writs haue bene vsually directed, giuing them authoritie to adiourne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the said Terme from Westminster aforesaid, vnto the sayd Citie of Winchester, there to begin in the saide <hi>Crastino Martini</hi> next ensuing, and so to continue.</p>
               <p>And his Maiesties pleasure is, that two of his Iustices, that is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177081:31"/> to say, of either Bench one, shall on the first day of the saide Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, called <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> according to the ancient Order of the Lawes, keepe the Essoynes of the said <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> and in the first day thereof, commonly called the day of Essoynes, the same Adiournement shall be made from the said <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> vntill <hi>Crastino Martini</hi> as aforesaid. And further his Maiesties pleasure is, that all matters, causes and suits betweene party and partie, in his Highnesse Courts of Chancery, Starre-chamber, Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, Dutchie of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and Court of Requests, shall haue continuance, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall haue day from the said <hi>Mense Michaelis</hi> vntill the sayd <hi>Crastino Martini,</hi> at the said Citie of Winchester. Willing them and euery of them to whome it doeth appertaine, to obserue and keepe their apparances and assemblies in all and euery his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse said Courts at the sayd Citie of Winchester in the sayd <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stino Martini,</hi> in like maner, forme, and condition, as they would, should, or ought to haue done, if the sayd Terme and Courts had bene holden and kept at Westminster, as they and euery of them will answere at their perils, Any thing in his Maiesties said for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse his Maiesties pleasure and commandement is, for the greater safety of his louing Subiects (which of any thing in this world hee chiefly desireth) in this infectious time, that no Issue triable by twelue or more Iurors this next Terme, shall receiue triall in any of his Maiesties Courts of Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, And that neither any Iurors summoned, or to be summoned to appeare at any Returne or day of this next Terme, shall appeare for triall of any such Issue, vnlesse it be for high Treason, or any matters or causes Criminall, Nor any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse either serued, or to be serued with Processe or otherwise, shal appeare, or giue in euidence for triall of any such Issue, (Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and matters or causes criminall excepted) but that both Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Witnesses may safely, according to his Maiesties graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaning herein expressed, reside and employ them in or about their owne affaires, without any forfeiture, penaltie, or losse whatsoeuer in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>And whereas by the sayd former Proclamation his Maiesties pleasure and commandement was, That notwithstanding the sayd former Adiournement, All Collectors, Receiuers, Sheriffes, and other Accomptants, and all other persons that should or ought to accompt, or pay any summe or summes of money in any of his Maiesties Courts of Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, and of his Dutchie of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177081:31"/> enter into any Accompt in any of the same Courts, should repaire vnto his Maiesties house of <hi>Richmond,</hi> where his highnesse had appointed such Officers and ministers, as for that purpose his Maiesty had thought expedient, and there to pay and doe in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry behalfe, as though no such Proclamation of Adiournement had bene had or made: And his highnesse further pleasure and commandement was, That all Sheriffes should returne their Writs and Processe against all such Accomptants and debters at the dayes therein appointed: And if any person or persons, who ought to accompt or pay any summe or summes of money to his Maiestie in any of the Courts and places aforesaid, should make default therein, That then his highnesse Writs and Processes should be awarded and sent foorth against euery such person and persons, and the same to be duely and orderly serued and returned by the Sheriffes and Officers thereunto appointed, in such like maner and forme as the same should haue bene, if the said former Proclamation had not bene made: And if any Sheriffe or other Officer should make default, or bee negligent in seruing, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or returning of any the Writs and Processe aforesayd, That then euery such Sheriffe and other Officer shall incurre such paines and penalties, as by the said Courts or any of them should be taxed and assessed: Now his Maiesties pleasure and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, That all the said Collectors, Receiuers, Sheriffes, and other Accomptants, and all other persons that shall or ought to accompt or pay any summe or summes of money, in any of his Maiesties said Courts of Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, and of his Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any Accompt in any of the sayd Courts, shall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth vntil the end of the next Terme, repaire vnto his Maiesties said house of <hi>Richmond,</hi> where his highnesse hath appointed such Officers and ministers as for that purpose hath bene thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and there al and euery thing and things to be performed, done, obserued, and proceeded with in such maner and forme, as by the sayd former Proclamation herein before recited, is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and commanded.</p>
               <p>And further, his Maiestie considering that if there should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be any accesse and apparance of his louing Subiects at the said City of <hi>Winchester</hi> during the residue of the Terme, of such as haue had the Plague in their houses, or haue bene themselues infected therewith, There might ensue great perill and damage to those that haue as yet bene cleare thereof, and so further incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience might grow thereby to the rest of the Realme: His high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse therefore, for the auoyding thereof, doeth straitly charge and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177081:32"/> command, That no such person or persons who haue bene so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or haue had the Plague in their houses at any time since the twentieth day of Iuly last, of what estate or degree soeuer he or they be, shall repaire to the said City of <hi>Winchester</hi> during the residue of the said Terme, except he or they shalbe commanded by speciall Processe, or otherwise haue speciall commandement for his or their personall appearance. And yet neuerthelesse, euery such person or persons so infected before his or their repaire to the said City of <hi>Winchester,</hi> shall before hee or they enter into any house within the said City or Suburbs thereof, openly notifie and declare by some message his or their estate touching his or their infection, with the cause for the which he or they shalbe called by Processe or other commandement, to such person or persons as shalbe appointed by the Lord Chancellor of England, to haue the charge of the gates and entries into the sayd City; So as if the sayd party shalbe ordered to come into the City, or into any Court within the sayd City, the same shall after during the time of his or their abode there, beare or hold vp in his or their hand vpright to be seene one red Rod of the length of one yard or more, vpon paine of his Maiesties displeasure, and imprisonment of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies during his highnesse pleasure.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation concerning such as seditiously seeke reformation in Church matters.</head>
               <p>AS we haue euer from our infancie had manifold proofes of Gods great goodnesse towards vs in his protecting of vs from many dangers of our Person, very neerely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs, and none more notorious then his happy conducting of vs in the late case of our succession to this Crowne, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to most mens expectation we haue receiued with more quiet and concurrencie of good will of our people (otherwise perhaps of different dispositions) then euer in like accident hath bene seene: So doe we thinke that the memory of his benefits ought to be a continuall solicitation to vs to shew our selues thankefull to his diuine Maiestie, wherein soeuer opportunitie shalbe offered vs to doe him seruice, but especially in things concerning his honour and Seruice, and the furtherance of the Gospel, which is the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty most beseeming Royall authority. Wherefore after our entry into this Kingdome, when we had receiued information of the state thereof at the decease of the Queene our sister of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Although we found the whole Body thereof in generall by the wisedome of her selfe and care of those who had the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration therof vnder her, in such good state of health as did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend their wisedomes, as well in the Politique part of it, as also in the Ecclesiasticall, whereof since we haue vnerstood the forme and frame, wee are perswaded that both the constitution and doctrine thereof is agreeable to Gods word, and neere to the condition of the Primitiue Church: Yet forasmuch as experience doeth shew dayly, that the Church militant is neuer so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in any forme of Policie, but that the imperfections of men who haue the exercise thereof, doe with time, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly, bring in some corruptions: As also for that informations
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177081:33"/> were dayly brought vnto vs by diuers, that some things vsed in this Church were both scandalous to many seeming zealous, and gaue aduantage to the aduersaries, We conceiued that no subiect could be so fit for vs to shew our thankefulnesse to God, as vpon serious examination of the state of this Church, to redeeme it from such scandals, as both by the one side and the other were layd vpon it. For our instruction wherein, we appointed a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be had before our selfe and our Counsell, of diuers of the Bishops and other learned men, the first day of the next moneth, by whose information and aduice we might gouerne our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein, if we found cause of amendment. But by reason of the sicknesse reigning in many places of our kingdome, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable time of the yeere for trauaile, and the incommoditie of the place of our abode for such an assembly, we were constrained to deferre it till after Christmas: At which Consultation we shall both more particularly vnderstand the state of the Church, and receiue thereby light to iudge whether there be indeed any such enormities as are pretended, and know how to proceed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse. But this our godly purpose we finde hath bene miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued by some mens spirits, whose heat tendeth rather to combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then reformation, as appeareth by the cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Some vsing publique Inuectiues against the state Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall here established, some contemning their Authoritie and the Processes of their Courts, some gathering subscriptions of multitudes of vulgar persons to Supplications to be exhibited to vs to craue that Reformation, which if there be cause to make, is more in our heart then in theirs. All which courses it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all men are vnlawfull and doe sauour of tumult, sedition, and violence, and not of such a Christian modestie as beseemeth those, who for pieties sake onely desire redresse of things they thinke to be amisse, and cannot but be the occasions of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous partialities, and perhaps of greater inconueniences among our people.</p>
               <p>For preuenting whereof, We haue thought it necessary to make publique declaration to all our Subiects, that as we haue reason to thinke the estate of the Church here established, and the degrees and orders of Ministers gouerning the same, to be agreeable to the word of God, and the forme of the Primitiue Church, hauing found the same blessed in the reigne of the late Queene, with great increase of the Gospel, and with a most happy &amp; long peace in the politique State, which two things, the true seruice of God, and happinesse of the State doe commonly concurre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So are wee not ignorant, that time may haue brought in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177081:33"/> some corruptions, which may deserue a reuiew and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if by the assembly intended by vs we shall finde to be so in deed, we will therein proceed according to the Lawes and customes of this Realme by aduise of our Councell, or in our high Court of Parliament, or by Conuocation of our Clergie, as we shall finde reason to leade vs; not doubting but that in such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceeding, we shall haue the Prelates and others of our Clergie no lesse willing, and farre more able to affoord vs their duety and seruice, then any other whose zeale goeth so fast before their discretion. Vpon which our Princely care, our pleasure is, that all our Subiects doe repose themselues, and leaue to our conscience that which to vs onely apperteineth, auoyding all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and factious maner of proceeding, for that hereafter if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall either by gathering the subscriptions of multitudes to Supplications, by contemptuous behauiour of any authority by the Lawes resting in Ecclesiasticall persons, by open inuectiues and vndecent speeches either in the Pulpit or otherwise, or by disobedience to the processes proceeding from their Iurisdiction, giue vs cause to thinke that he hath a more vnquiet spirit then becommeth any priuate person to haue toward publike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, We wil make it appeare by their chasticement, how farre such a maner of proceeding is displeasing to vs, and that we finde that these Reformers vnder pretended zeale affect Noueltie, and so confusion in all estates, whereas our purpose and resolution euer was, and now is to preserue the estate aswell Ecclesiasticall as Politike, in such forme as wee haue found it established by the Lawes here, reforming onely the abuses which wee shall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly finde prooued, And that also to doe by such mature aduise and deliberation, as we haue aboue mentioned. Wherefore we admonish all men hereby to take warning, as they will answere the contrary at their perill.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch as all our Subiects in the North parts, who haue felt the smart of the spoiles and outrages done vpon them at our first entrie into this Kingdome by diuers Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, but specially by the <hi>Greames,</hi> cannot bee ignorant what care we haue had that punishment should be done vpon the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hauing for that purpose to our great charge, maintained both Forces to apprehend them, and Commissioners to trie them according to the Law, by whose trauell, namely of our cousin the Earle of Cumberland our Lieutenant there, with assistance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commissioners, things are brought to that point, that the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177081:34"/> Offenders are all in our mercy, and doe all (but specially the <hi>Greames</hi>) confesse themselues to be no meete persons to liue in those Countreys, And therefore haue humbly besought vs that they might be remoued to some other parts, where with our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fauour, they hope to liue to become new men, and deserue our mercy.

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation concerning the choice of Knights and Burgesses for the Parliament.</head>
               <p>WE haue (before this time) made knowen to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects vpon diuers occasions, that we haue receiued so great contentment in their generall conformitie and submission to all such courses, as might best establish the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of this Crowne, according to the right of our Succession, as it would euer nourish in vs an earnest desire to shew our selues carefull in all things, to preserue their greatest affection, and to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177081:35"/> answere that expectation, which (by their ioyfull maner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs) Wee perceiued they had conceiued of our gouernment: Whereof, as we well know, that Princes cannot yeeld, more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, more cleare, or profitable proofe to their people, then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing abuses, wherewith they finde their Subiects iustly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, either in constitution, or administration of their Lawes in being, or by seeking to establish new Lawes for them, agreeable to the rules of Iustice, whensoeuer time doeth discouer any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the former Policy, or when accidents in the State of any Common wealth require new ordinances: So seeing both these things (which are of so great moment in a State) haue accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be considered and ordered (as in this, so in other well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned Common wealths) by a Lawfull assembly of the three Estates of the Realme, commonly called The Parliament; Wee were desirous to haue summoned them long since for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if the Infection (reigning in the City of London, and other places of our Kingdome) would haue permitted the concourse of so great a multitude into one place, as that Assembly must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily bring with it. Which great contagion being now by the goodnesse of God abated, and likely (as we hope) to be shortly quite extinguished in and about the said City, we haue resolued to hold a Parliament at our City of Westminster, as soone as we shall finde, that the same may be done without the perill aforesaid. In which, as God doeth know, that we haue nothing to propound for satisfaction of any priuate desire, or particular profit of our owne, but meerely and onely to consult and resolue with our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Subiects of all those things, which may best establish the publike good, with the generall safety and tranquillity of this Realme: (on which it hath pleased God to multiply so many blessings) so to the intent that this assembly of our Parliament (being grounded vpon so sincere an intent on our part) may be matched with a like integritie on theirs, And as it is the first in our Reigne, so to be found not onely worthy of the high Title it beareth, to be the highest Counsell of the kingdome, but also to be a president for hereafter of the true vse of Parliaments, We haue bethought our selfe, of as many wayes and meanes, as may be, to preuent those inconueniences, which dayly arise and multiply by the peruerting of those ancient good orders, which were deuised by the wisedome of former times to bee obserued in calling of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Amongst which, because there is no one point of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then the well chusing of Knights and Burgesses, who as they doe present the body of the third estate, so being eligible by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177081:35"/> multitude there are often many vnfit persons appointed for that Seruice: And where it is so well knowen to euery priuate man of wit and iudgement (much more to vs who haue had so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Kingly gouernment) how ill effects doe follow, when such as haue to doe in matters of Common wealth, shall come to that great &amp; common Councell, with other then publike minds, sincere, and voyd of any factious humour or dependencie: We doe hereby straitly charge and admonish all persons interessed in the choise of Knights for the Shires, First, that the Knights for the County be selected out of the principall knights or Gentlemen of sufficient hability within that County wherein they are chosen: And for the Burgesses, that choice be made of men of sufficiency and discretion without any partiall respects, or factious combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which alwayes breed suspitions, that more care is taken to compasse priuate ends, then to prouide for making good and wholesome Lawes for the Realme. And because it is no more pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to draw sound Counsels and resolutions from inconsiderate or insufficient spirits, then to haue a sound or healthfull body composed of weake and imperfect members: We doe likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish all persons to whom it doeth appertaine, That seeing the dealing in causes of Parliament, requires conueniencie of yeeres and experience, there may be great heed taken by all those that will be accompted louers of their Countrey, That both Knights and Burgesses may be chosen accordingly, without desire in any particuler men to please parents or friends, that often speake for their children or kinne, though they be very yong, and little able to discerne what Lawes are fit to binde a Common-wealth, To the consultation whereof those persons would be selected princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, of whose grauitie and modest conuersation men are likest generally to conceiue best opinion.</p>
               <p>Next and aboue all things, concerning that one of the maine pillars of this Estate, is the preseruation of Vnitie in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sincere Religion of Almighty God: We doe also admonish, that there be great care taken, to auoyd the choice of any persons either noted for their superstitious blindnesse one way, or for their turbulent humors other wayes: because their disorderly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet spirits, will disturbe all the discreet and modest proceeding in that greatest and grauest Councill. Further we do command, that an expresse care be had, that there be not chosen any persons Banquerupts or Outlawed, but men of knowen good behauiour and sufficient liuelyhood, and such as are not onely taxed to the payment of Subsidies and other like charges, but also haue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily payed and satisfied the same, Nothing being more absurd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177081:36"/> in any Common wealth, then to permit those to haue free voices for Law making, by whose owne actes they are exempted from the Lawes protection. Next, that all Shiriffes be charged that they doe not direct any Precept for electing and returning of any Burgesses to or for any ancient Borough towne within their Counties, being so vtterly ruined and decayed, that there are not sufficient Resiants to make such choice, and of whom lawfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection may be made, Also to charge all Cities and Boroughes, and the inhabitants of the same, that none of them seale any Blanckes, referring or leauing to any others to insert the names of any Citizens or Burgesses, to serue for any such City or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, but that the inhabitants of euery such City or Borough, doe make open and free Election according to the Law, and set downe the names of the persons whom they choose, before they seale the Certificate.</p>
               <p>Furthermore we notifie by these presents, that all Returnes and Certificats of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, ought and are to be brought to the Chancery, and there to be filed of Record. And if any shall be found to be made contrary to this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the same is to be reiected as vnlawfull and insufficient, and the City or Borough to be fined for the same. And if it be found that they haue committed any grosse or wilfull default and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in their Election, Returne, or Certificate, That then their Liberties according to the Law, are to be seized into our hands, as forfeited. And if any person take vpon him the place of a knight, citizen, or burgesse, not being duely elected, returned, and sworne according to the Lawes and statutes in that behalfe prouided, and according to the purport, effect and true meaning of this our Proclamation, Then euery person so offending to be fined and imprisoned for the same.</p>
               <p>We do also hereby giue warning to the Lords and others that are to serue in this Parliament, to haue special care, (as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our displeasure) That they admit none to haue the name or countenance of their seruants and attendants, during the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, seeing such questions of Priuiledge haue in times past consumed a great part of the time appointed for the Parliament, whereby the seruice for the Realme hath bene hindered, and the Subiects drawen to great charges and expences, by attending much longer then otherwise needed.</p>
               <p>Hau ng at this time bene the more carefull to set downe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order and forewarning for preuenting of these seuerall abuses afore mentioned, that thereby there may arise at that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and solemne meeting, such a comely proportion and laudable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177081:36"/> sympathy betweene the honourable, iust, and necessary Lawes that are to be made and established at this Parliament, and the commendable discretion, with all other wise and vertuous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meet for such persons as are to be the members and assisters of vs, in so honourable, lawfull, and necessary an Action, as may both put vs, and all our good Subiects in a sure expectation of a happy issue to follow thereupon: We doubt not but these our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections thus made manifest, shalbe duely obserued, according to the important consequence thereof, and the perill of our heauy displeasure to all those that shall offend in the contrary.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177081:37"/> profession, both saying Masses, perswading our Subiects from the Religion established, and reconciling them to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by consequence seducing them from the true perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which all Subiects ought to haue of their duety and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to vs. Wherefore, forasmuch as by way of prouidence to preserue their people from being corrupted in Religion, pietie and obedience, is not the least part of Royall duety, we hold our selfe obliged both in conscience and in wisedome, to vse all good meanes to keepe our Subiects from being infected with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious opinions in matter of Religion, which are not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to their owne soules, but the ready way and meanes to corrupt their duety and allegiance, which cannot be any way so surely performed, as by keeping from them the ministers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of that infection, which are the Priests of all sorts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in forraine parts, by authority prohibited by the Lawes of this land, Concerning whom therefore we haue thought it fit to publish to all our Subiects this open declaration of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. That where there be of Priests at this present within our kingdome, be they Regular or without Rule, diuers sorts, some in prison, some at libertie, and of both, some hauing obtained our pardon vnder our great Seale, and some hauing no such pardon: And againe some that were here before our comming into this Realme, and some commen hither since: For all such as are in prison we haue taken order that they shalbe shipped at some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient port, and sent out of our Realme as soone as possibly may be, with commandement not to returne againe into any part of our dominions, without our Licence obtained, vpon paine and perill of the Lawes being here in force against them, And for all others who are at libertie, whether hauing sued out our Pardon or not, which we doe aduertise them and all our Subiects, that extending onely to matters done before the death of the late Queene, doth not exempt any Priest from the danger of the Law for his abode here since our succession to the Crowne aboue the time by the Statute limitted.</p>
               <p>We doe hereby will and command all maner of Iesuits, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and other Priests whatsoeuer, hauing Ordination from any authoritie by the Lawes of this Realme prohibited, to take notice That our pleasure is, that they doe before the nineteenth day of March next ensuing the date hereof, depart foorth of our Realme and dominions, And that for that purpose it shalbe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to all Officers of our Ports, to suffer the said Priestes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence into any forreine parts, betweene this and the said nineteenth day of March: Admonishing and assuring all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177081:37"/> such Iesuits, Seminaries, and Priests of what sort soeuer, That if any of them shalbe after the said nineteenth day taken within this Realme or any our dominions, or departing now vpon this our pleasure signified, shall hereafter returne into this Realme or any our dominions againe, that they shalbe left to the penaltie of the Lawes here being in force concerning them, without hope of any fauour or remission from vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we will and command all Archbishops, Bishops, Lieutenants, Iustices of Peace, and all other our Officers and ministers whatsoeuer, to be vigilant and carefull after the sayd nineteenth day of March past, to doe their dueties and diligence in discouering and apprehending of all Priests that shall remaine here contrary to this our declaration. Which though perhaps it may seeme to some to presage a greater seueritie towards that sort of our Subiects, who differing in their profession from the Religion by Law established, call themselues <hi>Catholikes,</hi> then by our proceedings with them hitherto we haue giuen cause to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: Yet doubt we not, but that when it shalbe considered with indifferent iudgement, what causes haue mooued vs to vse this prouidence against the said Iesuits, Seminaries, and Priests, all men will iustifie vs therein. For to whom is it vnknowen, into what perill our person was like to be drawen, and our Realme vnto confusion not many moneths since, by a conspiracie first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by persons of that sort, who hauing preuailed with some, had vndertaken to draw multitudes of others to assist the same, by the authority of their perswasions and motiues grounded chiefly vpon matter of conscience and Religion? Which when other Princes shall duely obserue, we assure our selues they will no way conceiue that this alteration groweth from any change of disposition now more exasperate then heretofore, but out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary prouidence to preuent perils otherwise ineuitable, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their absolute submission to forreine Iurisdiction at their first taking of Orders, doeth leaue so conditionall an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Kings ouer their Subiects, as the same power by which they were made, may dispense at pleasure with the straitest band of loyalty and loue betweene a King and his people. Amongst which Forreine powers, although we acknowledge our selues personally so much beholding to the now Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for his kinde Offices and priuate temporall cariage towards vs in many things, as we shall bee euer ready to requite the same towards him, (as Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in state and condition of a Secular Prince) Yet when we consider and obserue the course and claime of that Sea, we haue no reason to imagine, that Princes of our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177081:38"/> Religion and profession, can exspect any assurance long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, vnlesse it might be assented by mediation of other Princes Christian, that some good course might be taken (by a generall Councell free and lawfully called) to plucke vp those roots of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and iealousies which arise for cause of Religion as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes and Princes, as betweene them and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and to make it manifest that no State or Potentate either hath or can challenge power to dispose of earthly Kingdomes or Monarchies, or to dispense with Subiects obedience to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Soueraignes: In which charitable Action, there is no Prince liuing, that will be readier then we shall be to concurre euen to the vttermost of our power, not onely out of particular disposition to liue peaceably with all States and Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, but because such a setled amitie might (by an vnion in Religion) be established among Christian Princes, as might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs all to resist the common Enemie.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and Vniformitie of the Booke of Common Prayer to be vsed throughout the Realme.</head>
               <p>ALthough it cannot be vnknowen to our Subiects by the former Declarations wee haue published, what our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and proceedings haue bene in matters of Religion since our comming to this Crowne: Yet the same being now by vs reduced to a setled forme, we haue occasion to repeat somewhat of that which hath passed; And how at our very first entry into the Realme being intertained and importuned with informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sundry Ministers, complayning of the errors and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Church here, aswell in matter of Doctrine as of Discipline; Although we had no reason to presume that things were so farre amisse, as was pretended, because we had seene the Kingdome vnder that forme of Religion which by Law was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the dayes of the late Queene of famous memory, blessed with a peace and prosperitie, both extraordinary and of many yeeres continuance (a strong euidence that God was therewith well pleased,) Yet because the importunitie of the Complayners
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177081:38"/> was great, their affirmations vehement, and the zeale where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the same did seeme to be accompanied, very specious; Wee were mooued thereby to make it our occasion to discharge that duety which is the chiefest of all Kingly dueties, That is, to settle the affaires of Religion, &amp; the Seruice of God before their owne. Which while wee were in hand to doe, as the Contagion of the sickenesse raigning in our City of <hi>London</hi> and other places would permit an assembly of persons meete for that purpose; Some of those who misliked the state of Religion here established, prefu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming more of our intents then euer wee gaue them cause to doe, and transported with humor, began such proceedings as did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raise a scandal in the Church, then take offence away. For both they vsed formes of publique seruing of God not here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, held assemblies without Authority, &amp; did other things ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a very apparant shew of sedition, more then of zeale: whom we restrained by a former ProclamatiÅ in the moneth of October last, and gaue intimation of the Conference we intended to be had with as much speede as conueniently could be, for the ordering of those things of the Church, which accordingly followed in the moneth of Ianuary last at our Honour of <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where before our selfe, and our Priuy Counsell were assembled many of the grauest Bishops and Prelats of the Realme, and many other learned men, as well of those that are conformable to the State of the Church established, as of those that dissented: Among whom, what our paines were, what our patience in hearing and replying, and what the indifferencie and vprightnes of our Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in determining, we leaue to the report of those who heard the same, contenting our selfe with the sinceritie of our owne heart therein. But we cannot conceale, that the successe of that Conference was such as happeneth to many other things, which moouing great expectation before they be entred into, in their issue produce small effects. For we found mighty and vehement Informations supported with so weake and slender proofes, as it appeared vnto vs and our Councell, that there was no cause why any change should haue bene at all in that which was most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, the Booke of Common Prayer, conteyning the forme of the publike Seruice of God here established, neither in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which appeared to be sincere, nor in the Formes and Rites which were iustified out of the practise of the Primitiue Church. Notwithstanding we thought meete, with consent of the Bishops and other learned men there present, That some small things might rather be explaned then changed; not that the same might not very well haue bene borne with by men who would haue
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:177081:39"/> made a reasonable construction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the Seruice of God we were nice, or rather iealous, that the publique forme thereof should be free not onely from blame, but from suspition, so as neither the common Aduersary should haue aduantage to wrest ought therein conteined, to other sence then the Church of England intendeth, nor any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some or ignorant person of this Church be able to take the least occasion of cauill against it: And for that purpose gaue foorth, our Commission vnder our great Seale of England to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Canterbury and others, according to the forme which the Lawes of this Realme in like case prescribe to be vsed, to make the said explanation, and to cause the whole Booke of Common Prayer, with the same explanations, to be newly printed. Which being now done, and established anew after so serious a delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Although we doubt not, but all our Subiects, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and others will receiue the same with such reuerence as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth, and conforme themselues thereunto euery man in that which him concerneth: Yet haue we thought it necessary, to make knowen by Proclamation our authorizing of the same, And to require and enioyne all men, aswel Ecclesiasticall as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, to conforme themselues vnto it, and to the practise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the onely Publike forme of seruing of God, established and allowed to be in this Realme. And the rather, for that all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who were there present, aswel of the Bishops as others, promised their conformitie in the practise of it, onely making sute to vs, that some few might be borne with for a time.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other publique Ministers aswell Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill, to doe their dueties in causing the same to be obeyed, and in punishing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours according to the Lawes of the Realme heretofore esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, for the authorizing of the said Booke of Common Prayer. And we thinke it also necessary, that the said Archbishops, and Bishops, doe each of them in his Prouince and Diocesse take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That euery Parish doe procure to themselues within such time as they shall thinke good to limit, one of the said Bookes so explaned. And last of all we doe admonish all men, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they shall not expect nor attempt any further alteration in the Common &amp; Publique forme of Gods Seruice, from this which is now established, for that neither will wee giue way to any to presume, that our owne iudgement hauing determined in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this weight, shalbe swayed to alteration by the friuolous suggestions of any light spirit: neither are we ignorant of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences that doe arise in gouernment, by admitting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177081:39"/> in things once setled by mature deliberation: And how necessary it is to vse constancie in the vpholding of the publique determinations of States, for that such is the vnquietnesse and vnstedfastnesse of some dispositions, affecting euery yeere new formes of things, as, if they should be followed in their vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, would make all actions of States ridiculous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: whereas the stedfast maintayning of things by good aduise established, is the weale of all Common wealths.</p>

               <p>THe Lords of the priuie Counsell endeuouring heretofore the like furtherance of the seruice of the State, aswell in horsing such as ride on their Princes affaires, as the speedy dispatch of Packets in all places, where Posts were erected and ordeined, considering, that for the seruice of the one, a daily fee is allowed, and for the other no certaine wages at all, but the hire of the horses let out, and that often ill paide, whereby they stand not so bound to the one, as to attend the other: And that the townes and Countreys besides became many wayes vexed and perplexed, by the ouer great libertie of Riders in Poste, specially by such as pretend publike seruice by speciall Commission, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings meaning or their Lordships Orders: Who minding nothing more, then the particular good of his seruants and Subiects: for the benefite of the one, reliefe of the other, and more regard to the good vsage of all Owners of horses, and the beasts themselues, did thinke it expedient, to digest and set downe sundry necessary Orders indifferent for all parties to obserue and follow. Which Orders being by vs reuiewed and considered, are now according to the necessitie of the times, thought meete to be eftsoones allowed and published. The execution whereof we seriously recommending to the Master and Controller of all our Posts, for the better warranting and directing of Posts, so farre as this seruice may concerne them, Wee doe hereby straightly charge and command, all and euery Lieutenants of Shires, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie Lieutenants, Iustices of all Assises and peace, Sheriffes, Maiors, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177081:40"/> Officers, Ministers, and louing Subiects, to be ayding and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting to the same, with their vtmost helpe, authoritie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance where need shall require, as they tender the furtherance of the seruice of the State, and our displeasure.</p>
               <p n="1">1 First it is ordered, That in all places where Posts are layde for the Packet, they also as persons most fit, shall haue the benefit and preheminence of letting, furnishing, and appointing of horses to all riding in Poste, (that is to say) with Horne and Guide by Commission or otherwise, And to that end shall keepe, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their owne, or haue in a readinesse vnder their direction, such and so many able and sufficient Post horses, with conuenient furniture, as their owne abilities will beare, or that the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary prouision of the townes and Countreys shal enable them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or afford. And if it fall out that Curriers or thorow-Posts, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our affaires by speciall Commission come so thicke, or in such numbers, that their ordinary prouision will not suffice, then the Constables of the places where they dwell, with the assistance of the chiefe Magistrates there, and of the Countreys adioyning, (being required in our name) shall take vp, bring in, and supply the Posts with horses where they may be had or hired.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And like as in the Orders for the carrying of the Packets, the furtherance of our seruice and the State, is onely aymed at, so in this it is intended, that none be holden to ride on publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, but with speciall Commission, and the same signed either by one of our principall Secretaries of State, or sixe at the least of our priuy Counsell, or the Master and Comptroller generall of the Posts, for all iourneys outwards, and from the Court onely. And to the Court, the Lords of the priuie Counsell of Scotland, any Lieutenant, Deputie or Gouernours in Ireland, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Counsels, or Vicepresidents established in the North, or in the Marches of Wales, the Gouernour of Barwicke, Any Ambassadour, Gouernours of townes, or Agents beyond the Seas, The Warden of the Cinque Ports, or his Lieutenant of Douer, specially sending to the Court, to the body of the Counsel, or Secretaries of State, or any Packet so directed, that it may appeare, the partie dispatched therewith, rideth in our speciall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, (the Ambassadors of forreine Princes within this our Realme, and the ordinary Posts for France and Flanders allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by their badges sufficiently commissionated, excepted) and of all such so riding in publike affaires, it shall be lawfull for the Posts, or the Owners of the horses, to demand for the hire of ech horse after the rate of two pence halfe-peny the mile, (besides the Guides groats.) But of all others riding poste with horne and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:177081:40"/> Guide, about their priuate businesses, the hire and prices are left to the parties discretions to agree and compound within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It shal not be lawful for any person whatsoeuer riding in post by Commission or otherwise, to take and ride away the horse or horses of any man, Post or other, not hauing first and aforehand fully payd and satisfied for the price and hire vnto the Owners or the Post for them, nor ride them further then the next immediate Stage without changing, without the knowledge and consent of the Post of the Stage, by whom he rideth in post, nor charge any horse so taken to ride in poste with any Male, or burden, (besides his Rider) that exceedeth the weight of thirtie pounds: Neither shall any man so riding in poste, offer to ride any mans horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue seuen miles the houre in Summer, <hi>viz.</hi> From the first of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, till the last of September, nor aboue sixe in Winter, which shall bee accounted the rest of the yeere: And if any shall wilfully disobey herein or in any point hereof to the manifest hurt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the horse or his Owner, The Officers &amp; Magistrates of the place vpon complaint made, shall stay the parties offending vntill they haue giuen present satisfaction, or sufficient securitie to repay the damage.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, as it is onely intended that our seruice in this kind, be at all hands furthered, and the Posts to that end, in all their wants and wrongs to right themselues by the helpe and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Magistrates, Townes and Countreys as abouesaid: So if the seruice shall seeme vnto any Post a burden ouer great for his priuate state to beare and vndertake, and the townes and Countreys (notwithstanding the ease and quiet they reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) no way willing to countenance, encourage or enable him thereto: or otherwise in regard of yeeres or indisposition, shall not see reason to vnderlie the charge, and trouble of the seruice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hinderance to his speciall duetie in the seruice of the Packet: The Post in such case attending his peculiar charge, the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Magistrates of the places shall take order from time to time, that horses be prouided for all riding in poste by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or specially sent in our affaires as beforesaid, in such sort as they were subiect to doe before there were any Posts there, and as in places where are yet no standing Postes at all. Vnto whom also our pleasure is, that these Orders shall bee in force, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable (being deliuered them from the Master and Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Posts) so farre as they, and any branch of them may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the furtherance of publike seruice, or their owne reliefe.</p>

               <p>WHereas heretofore the Lords of the Priuie Counsell to the Queene our Sister deceased, for great and weighty causes concerning the State, haue ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to set downe, and publish sundry Orders, and generall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for matters of Posting, especially for the speedy dispatch of Packets and Letters importing the Princes immediate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the colour whereof seruing priuate turnes, hath greatly frustrated their endeuours:</p>
               <p>It is now therefore, for the better warrantise and direction of our Posts, thought meet and conuenient, that the former Orders be reuiued, and (according to the necessity of the times) renewed and published in our name in maner as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, euery Post receiuing a dayly Fee, and entertained specially for the Packet, according to the proportion of his wages by the day, shall keepe certaine Horses, to the number of two at the least, with furniture conuenient, and those alwayes to haue at hand in a readinesse to runne with our Packets onely in Post, so soone as the same are brought to his hands. He shall haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so two Bags of Leather at the least well lined with Bayes or Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to cary the Packet in, and Hornes to sound and blow, as oft as he meets company, or foure times in euery mile.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Euery Post thus furnished, shall at all houres receiue and cary, or send away, all Packets or Letters brought vnto him, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for our speciall Affaires, dated on the outside, with the time and place of their first deliuery, and subscribed by the hands of our Principall Secretaries, and Master and Comptroller ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Postes: And for matters of the Nauy, or to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Forts vpon the Sea coast, or principall Port Townes, by our Admirall of England: For matters of the Cinque Ports, by our Warden: For matters of Scotland, by our Treasurer and Secretary of Scotland: And for Ireland, by our Lieutenant the L. <hi>MoHntioy,</hi> Or addressed to them in the proper businesse of their places, or to the body of our Counsell, from what persons or places whatsoeuer: Of whose names, and addresse onely, the Posts shall take notice, according to the first institution, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall vse of their seruice, and of none other.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:177081:41"/>3. Euery Post so receiuing our Packets, directed and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as abouesaid, shall within one quarter of an houre at the most after they come to his handes, dispatch them away in Post, and shall runne therewith in Sommer (that is, from the first of April to the last of September) after seuen miles the houre: and in Winter (which shall be esteemed the rest of the yeere) after fiue miles the houre at the least, as the wayes affoord, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that it may appeare from time to time (when, and as often as it shalbe required) with what care and diligence the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is at al hands applyed and performed, Euery Post shall keepe a large and faire leger Paper Booke to enter our Packets in, as they shalbe brought vnto him, with the day of the moneth, houre of the day or night, that they came first to his handes, together with the name of him or them, by whom or vnto whom they were subscribed and directed, taking and entring onely such for our Packets, as come warranted as aforesaid, and all others to passe as By-letters.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation enioyning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to the forme of the Seruice of God established.</head>
               <p>THe care which we haue had, and paines which we haue taken to settle the affaires of this Church of England in an Vniformitie as well of Doctrine, as of Gouernment, both of them agreeable to the word of God, the doctrine of the Primitiue Church, and the Lawes heretofore established for those matters in this Realme, may sufficiently appeare by our former actions. For no sooner did the Infection of the Plague, raigning
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177081:45"/> immediatly after our entry into this kingdome, giue vs leaue to haue any Assembly, but we held at our honour of <hi>Hampton</hi> Court for that purpose a Conference betweene some principall Bishops and Deanes of this Church, and such other learned men as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood or fauoured the opinions of those that seeke Alteration, before our selfe and our Councell. Of which Conference the issue was, That no well grounded matter appeared to vs or our sayd Councell, why the state of the Church here by Law established, should in any materiall point be altered, Nor did those that before had seemed to affect such Alteration, when they heard the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Arguments, greatly insist vpon it, but seemed to be satisfied themselues, and to vndertake within reasonable time to satisfie all others that were misse-led with opinion that there was any iust cause of Alteration. Whereupon we published by our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation what had bene the Issue of that Conference, hoping that when the same should be made knowen, all reasonable men would haue rested satisfied with that which had bene done, and not haue mooued further trouble or speech of matters, whereof so solemne and aduised determination had bene made. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, at the late Assembly of our Parliament, there wanted not many that renewed with no little earnestnesse the Questions before determined, and many more aswell about the Booke of Common Prayer, as other matters of Church gouernment, and importuned vs for our Assent to many Alterations therein: But yet with such successe, as when they had heard both our owne speaches made vnto them at sundry times, shewing the reasons of our former proceedings in those matters, And likewise had had Conference with some Bishops, and other Lords of the Vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house about the same, they desisted from further prosecution thereof; finding, that of all things that might any way tend to the furtherance of Religion, and establishment of a Ministery fit for the same, we had before with the aduise of our Counsell, had such consideration, as the present state of things would beare, And taken order how the same should bee prosecuted by such meanes, as might be vsed without any publique disturbance or Innouation: And so the end of all their motions and ouertures falling out to be none other in substance, then was before at the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, That is, that no apparant or grounded reason was shewed, why either the Booke of Common Prayer, or the Church discipline here by law established should be changed (which were vnreasonable) considering that particular and personall abuses are remediable otherwise, then by making generall Alterations: We haue thought good once againe to giue
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177081:46"/> notice thereof to all our Subiects, by publike Declaration, who we doubt not but will receiue great satisfaction, when they shall vnderstand that after so much impugning, there appeareth no cause why the forme of the Seruice of God, wherein they haue bene nourished so many yeeres, should bee changed: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to admonish them all in general to conforme themselues thereunto, without listning to the troublesome spirits of some persons, who neuer receiue contentment, either in Ciuill, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall matters, but in their owne fantasies, especially of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ministers, who vnder pretended Zeale of Reformation, are the chiefe Authors of diuisions and Sects among our people. Of many of which, we hope that now, when they shall see that such things as they haue proposed for Alteration, proue vpon triall so weakely grounded, as deserue not admittance, they will out of of their owne iudgement conforme themselues to better aduice, and not omit the principall and substantiall parts of their duties, for shadowes and semblances of Zeale, but rather bend their strength with our intent to ioyne in one end, that is, the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, and recouering of our people seduced out of the hands of the common aduersaries of our Religion, which shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be well performed but by an Vniformitie of our endeuours therein. But if our hope herein faile vs, we must aduertise them, that our duety towards God requireth at our handes, that what vntractable men doe not performe vpon admonition, they must be compelled vnto by Authority, whereof the Supreme power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in our hands, by Gods ordinance, wee are bound to vse the same in nothing more, then in preseruation of the Churches tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, which by Gods grace we are fully purposed to doe: And yet by aduise of our Councell, &amp; opinion of the Bishops, although our former Proclamations both before the Conference and since, ought to be a sufficient warning and admonition to all men, who are within the danger of them, Wee haue thought good to giue time to all Ministers disobedient to the Orders of the Church and to Ecclesiasticall Authority here by Law established, and who for such disobedience, either in the dayes of the Queene our sister of famous memory deceased, or since our Reigne haue incurred any censures of the Church, or penalties of Lawes, vntill the last of Nouember now next ensuing, to bethinke themselues of the course they will hold therein.</p>
               <p>In which meane time both they may resolue either to conforme themselues to the Church of England, and obey the same: Or els to dispose of themselues and their families some other wayes, as to them shall seeme meete: And the Bishops and others whom it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177081:46"/> concerneth, prouide meete persons to be substitutes in the place of those who shall wilfully abandon their Charges vpon so sleight causes: Assuring them that after that day, we shall not faile to do that which Princely prouidence requireth at our hands: That is, to put in execution all wayes and meanes that may take from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our people, all grounds and occasions of Sects, diuisions, and vnquietnesse: Whereof as we wish there may neuer be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion giuen vs to make proofe, but that this our admonition may haue equall force in all mens hearts, to worke an vniuersall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie: So we doe require all Archbishops, Bishops, and other Ecclesiastical persons, to doe their vttermost endeuours by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, arguments, perswasions, and by all other wayes of loue and gentlenesse to reclaime all that be in the Ministery, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of our Church Lawes; For which purpose onely wee haue enlarged the time formerly prefixed for their remoue or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to the end that if it be possible, that Vniformity which we desire, may be wrought by clemencie, and by weight of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not by rigour of Law. And the like aduertisement doe we giue to all Ciuill Magistrates, Gentlemen, and others of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as well abroad in the Counties, as in Cities and townes, Requiring them also, not in any sort to support, fauour, or countenance any such factious Ministers in their obstinacie: of whose endeuours we doubt not, but so good successe may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as this our admonition, with their indeuours, may preuent the vse of any other meanes to reteine our people in their due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to vs, and in vnitie of minde, to the Seruice of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation concerning the Kings Maiesties Stile, of King of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>AS often as we call to minde the most ioyfull and iust Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition made by the whole body of our Realme, in the first Session of our high Court of Parliament, of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which it hath pleased God to reserue many yeeres in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence to our Person, and now in the fulnesse of the time of his disposition, to bestow vpon vs; Namely the blessed Vnion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuniting of these two mightie, famous, and ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of England and Scotland, vnder one Imperial Crowne: So often doe we thinke, that it is our duetie to do our vttermost endeuour, for the aduancement and perfection of that worke, which is of his beginning, and whereof hee hath giuen so many palpable signes and arguments, as hee that seeth them not, is blinde, and he that impugneth them, doeth but endeuour to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that, which God hath put together. For, to omit those things which are euident to sense, That the Isle within it selfe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most none but imaginarie bounds of separation without, but one common limit or rather Gard of the Ocean Sea, making the whole a litle world within it selfe, the Nations an vniformitie of constitutions both of body and minde, especially in Martiall prowesses, a communitie of language, the principall meanes of Ciuil societie, An vnitie of Religion, the chiefest band of heartie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:177081:48"/> Vnion, and the surest knot of lasting Peace: What can be a more expresse Testimonie of Gods authoritie of this worke, then that two mightie Nations, hauing bene euer from their first separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continually in blood each against other, should for so many yeeres immediatly before our Succession, be at peace together, as it were to this end, That their memory being free from sence of the smart of former iniuries, their minds might, in the time of Gods appointment, more willingly come together, That it hath pleased him so to dispose, that this Vnion is not inforced by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and violence, nor contracted by doubtfull and deceiuable points of transaction, but naturally deriued from the Right and Title of the precedent Princes of both Kingdomes, concurring in our person, alike lineally descended from the blood of both through the sacred coniunction of wedlocke, An Vnion which is the work of God and Nature, and whereunto the works of force and policy cannot attaine? We may adde hereunto that which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from those that be skilfull in the Lawes of this land, That immediatly vpon our succession, diuers of the ancient Lawes of this Realme are <hi>Ipso facto</hi> expired, As namely, that of Escuage, and of the Naturalization or the Subiects, And that there is a greater affinitie and concurrence betweene most of the ancient Lawes of both kingdomes, then is to be found betweene those of any other two Nations, As namely, in states of inheritance and Freehold, as Fee-simple, Fee-taile, Tenant for life, by Courtesie, Dower and such like, In Cases of descents of inheritance, In te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures of Lands, as of Knights seruice, socage, Franke Almoigne, Burgage, Villenage, and such like, In writts and formes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, In cases of Triall by Iuries, Grand Iuries, And lastly in Officers and ministers of Iustice, as Sheriffes, Coroners, and such like, which we leaue to be further considered by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of both Realmes.</p>
               <p>All which being matter prepared onely by the prouidence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and which by humane industry could not haue bene so ordered; We, and all our Subiects ought first with reuerence to acknowledge his Handy-worke therein, and to giue him our most humble thankes for the same, and then to further by our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours that, which his Wisedome doeth by so many signes point out to be his will: Whereof many particularities depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the determinations of the States and Parliaments of both Realmes, wee leaue them there to be discussed, according to the Commissions granted by the seuerall Acts of both Parliaments. And some other things resting in our owne Imperiall power, as the head of both, we are purposed towards the building of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:177081:48"/> worke, to doe by our selfe that, which iustly and safely we may by our absolute power do. And for a first stone of this worke, whereupon the rest may be layed, seeing there is vndoubtedly but one Head to both peoples, which is our selfe; And that vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we haue but one heart and minde to communicate equally to both States, as lines issuing from one Center, Our Iustice, our fauours, and whatsoeuer else dependeth vpon the Vnitie of our supreme power ouer both, (God hauing ministred to vs so iust cause to embrace them both with equall and indifferent loue, in as much as our birth, and the first part of our life hath bene in the one, and the later part thereof is like to be for the most part in the other:) Wee thinke it vnreasonable, that the thing, which is by the worke of God and nature so much in effect one, should not be one in name; Vnitie in name being so fit a meanes to imprint in the hearts of people, a Character and memoriall of that Vnitie, which ought to be amongst them in deed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we haue thought good to discontinue the diuided names of England and Scotland out of our Regall stile, and doe intend and resolue to take and assume vnto vs in maner &amp; forme hereafter expressed, The name &amp; stile of <hi>KING OF GREAT BRITAINE,</hi> including therein according to the trueth, the whole Island. Wherein no man can imagine vs to be led by any humour of vaineglory or ambition, because we should in that case rather delight in a long enumeration of many Kingdomes, and Seigniories, (wherof in our inheritance we haue plenty ynough, if we thought there were glory in that kinde of Stile) but onely that we vse it as a signification of that, which in part is already done, and a significant prefiguration of that, which is to be done hereafter; Nor that we couet any new affected name deuised at our pleasure, but out of vndoubted knowledge doe vse the true and ancient name, which God and Time haue imposed vpon this Isle, extant, and receiued in histories, in all Mappes and Cartes, wherein this Isle is described, and in ordinary Letters to our selfe from diuers forreine Princes, warranted also by Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Charters, exemplifications vnder Seales, and other Records of great Antiquitie, giuing vs president for our doing, not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of forraine Nations, but from the actes of our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Kings of this Realme of England, both before and since the Conquest, hauing not had so iust and great cause as we haue.</p>
               <p>Vpon all which considerations we do by these presents, by force of our Kingly power and Prerogatiue, assume to our selfe by the cleerenesse of our Right, The Name and Stile of <hi>KING OF GREAT BRITAINE, FRANCE, AND IREAND,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177081:49"/> DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, &amp;c.</hi> as followeth in our iust and lawfull Stile, And doe hereby publish, promulge and declare the same, to the end that in all proclamations, Missiues forreine, and domesticall, Treaties, Leagues, Dedicatories, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and in all other cases of like nature, the same may be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and obserued. And to the end the same may be the sooner and more vniuersally diuulged both at home and abroad: Our will and pleasure is, That the same Stile be from hencefoorth vsed vpon all Inscriptions vpon our currant Moneys and Coines of Gold and Siluer hereafter to be minted. And for that we do not innouate or assume to Vs any new thing, but declare that which is and hath bene euident to all; Our will and pleasure is, That in such Appellations or Nominations, as shall be hereafter made by force of these presents, the same shall bee expressed in such and the same maner and forme, and after such computation, as if wee had assumed and declared the same the first day of our Reigne of our Realme of England; Forbearing onely for the present that any thing herein conteined doe extend to any Legall proceeding, instrument, or assurance, vntill further order bee taken in that behalfe.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for Coynes.</head>
               <p>ALthough it be most certaine, that nothing is more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the Soueraigne dignitie of Princes, then the ordering of their Moneys, and setting them at such prices and valuations, as they shall thinke conuenient vpon necessary causes; Yet haue we alwayes bene of opinion, that iust Princes should not vse the libertie of their power in abasing or enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177081:50"/> the prices of Moneys, without all respect to the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of their Subiects. In which consideration it is euident to all men, that since our entrie into this Realme, we haue bene so farre from changing the ancient and honourable Standard of the Starling Money of this our Realme of England, as wee haue on the contrary restored to our Realme of Ireland Moneis of pure Siluer, in lieu of the base Coyne, with which the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the time, by accident of the warres, constrained our sister the late Queene of happy memory to pay the Armies.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, it falling out at our first comming out of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (where wee had Coynes of Gold and Siluer not then cne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this Realme) to be impossible for our Nobilitie and other seruants and Subiects attending vs in our iourney hither, to be prouided of currant Moneys of this Realme for their expenses so soone as our speed required; Wee did then giue valuation to the Coyne of Golde of Scotland, called the Sixe pound piece, to be currant here for ten shillings of Siluer, and to be equall to the English Angel or Soueraigne of Gold: The authorizing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of comming lately into consideration, among other points recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by vs to be treated for the weale of both Kingdomes, by some of our Counsell of each of them, It hath appeared that the inconuenience is fit to be remoued, which groweth by our autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing it to be equall to the Gold Coynes of England: Not that it is not worth in true value ten shillings of our Siluer moneys of England, but because that the English Coynes of Gold are not in regard of the Siluer Coynes, of the true proportion betweene Gold and Siluer accustomed in all Nations.</p>
               <p>Whereupon our Councell hauing occasion to enter into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration of the Moneys of this Realme, with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Officers of the Mint, it appeareth very visibly, that this errour in the proportion of the Gold moneys of England to the Siluer, hath bene a great cause of the transportation of Gold out of this Realme into forraine Countreys in such quantity, as of late yeeres hath bene vsed, because the sayd Gold moneys are more worth in their true value, then here they were allowed. To which inconuenience long endured, being now resolued to giue remedy, we haue caused new Coynes both of Gold and Siluer to be made of seuerall stampes, weights and values, but of one vniforme Standard and allay, to be currant within this our Kingdome of <hi>GREAT BRITAINE:</hi> that is to say, One piece of Gold of the value of Twentie shillings sterling, to be called <hi>The Vnite,</hi> stamped on the one side with our Picture formerly vsed, with this our Stile, <hi>IACOBVS D'.

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for the Proroguing of the Parliament.</head>
               <p>WHereas at the late rising of the first Sesion of our Parliament, We did prorogue the same vntill the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of February next, intending then to holde at that time another Session thereof: We haue since bene infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from diuers parts of our Realme, that some contagion of sickenesse doeth yet so continue in many of our principall Cities and Townes, and is also scattered in diuers other places of lesse note, as if we should against the Spring of the yeere draw so great a concourse of people together, as the assembly of the Parliament bringeth with it, (the continuance wherof is vncertaine) it were much to be doubted, that the infection of the plague might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againe in our City of London, which is our Chamber, and the place of our most ordinary residence, as it did the first yeere of our entry, by reason of the great assembly at our Coronation, which if the setling of our State here had not necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be then performed, Wee would haue forborne. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much also as for these two yeeres past, by reason of our entry into this our Kingdome, our Coronation, the holding of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and such other solemnities, requiring the presence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the best sort, the most part of the Gentlemen of qualitie of this Realme haue bene absent from the places of their ordinary aboad, whereby the Countreys haue wanted their assistance in the gouernment of them, and our people the comfort of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Hospitalitie: We haue therefore thought it conuenient to prorogue our sayd Parliament vntill the third day of October next ensuing, at which time we intend by Gods grace to holde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Session thereof, And in the meane time all those, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired hither about the Commission concerning the Vnion, or doe now reside here in expectation of that Session of our Parliament at the time appointed, may returne to their owne homes vntill the sayd third day of October, when we will expect againe their attendance. And in the meane time we doe straitly charge and command them, and all other who haue any trust to them from vs, either in the Commission of the peace, or otherwise for the good gouernment of our people, that they doe immediatly repaire home to their owne dwellings, to attend to such Seruices as to them belong to doe, whereof by their absence both wee and our Subiects are defrauded.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177081:56"/> Pirats to robbe both our owne Subiects their Countreymen, and the subiects of other Princes our neighbours, going in their honest Trade of Merchandize: By which courses they doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the quiet traffique of Nations one with other, leaue our Realme vnfurnished of men of their sort, if we should haue cause to vse them, and inure themselues to an impious disposition of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by rapine and euill meanes, although by reason of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall peace wherein wee are at this present with all Christian Princes and States, they may haue a more plentifull employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an orderly and lawfull Nauigation, then at any time of late yeeres they could haue had: We haue thought it necessary in time to preuent the spreading of such a corruption amongst our Subiects of that sort and calling, whereby our Nation will be so much slandered, &amp; our Realme so greatly disaduantaged. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doe will and command all Masters of ships, Pilots, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and all other sort of Seafaring men, who now are in the Martiall seruice of any forreine States, that they doe presently returne home into their owne Countrey, and leaue all such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Seruices, and betake themselues to their vocation in the lawfull course of Merchandize, and other orderly Nauigation, vpon such paines and punishments as by the Lawes of our Realme may be inflicted vpon them, if after this declaration of our pleasure, they shall not obey. And we doe also vpon the same paines straitly charge and command al our Subiects of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that none of them shall from hencefoorth take Letters of Marke or Reprisall, nor serue vnder any that hath such letters of Marke or Reprisall from any forreine Prince or State whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, Nor otherwise employ themselues in any warlike Seruices of any forraine State vpon the Sea, without speciall License obtained from our selfe, or from our high Admirall, as they will answere the contrary at their perils.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as although we are in Peace with all Christian Princes and States, yet during the continuance of the Warre betweene the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Archdukes on the one side, and the vnited Prouinces of the Low-Countreys on the other side, many chances may happen, as some already haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, of difficult interpretation to our Officers and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects how to behaue themselues in such cases, vnlesse they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed vnto them: Wee haue thought it conuenient to make an open declaration how our said Officers and Subiects shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themselues towards the Subiects aswell of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and Archdukes, as also of the States vnited in the cases following.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:177081:56"/>
               <p>First our pleasure is, That within our Portes, Hauens, Rodes, Creekes, or other places of our Dominion, or so neere to any of our sayd Portes or Hauens, as may bee reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued to bee within that Title, Limit, or Precinct, there shall be no force, violence, surprise, or offence suffered to be done either from Man of warre to Man of warre, or Man of warre to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or Merchant to Merchant of either party, but that all of what Nation soeuer, so long as they shall bee within those our Ports and places of our Iurisdiction, or where our Officers may prohibite violence, shall bee vnderstood to be vnder our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to bee ordered by course of Iustice, and be at peace each with other.</p>
               <p>And whereos some of the Men of warre of ech side haue vsed of late, and it is like will vse in time to come, though not to come within our Ports, because there they know wee can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine violence, yet to houer and hang about the skirts of our Ports, somewhat to Seaboard, but yet so neere our coastes and the entrie of our Harbours, as in reason is to be construed to be within the extent of the same, and there to await the Merchant of the aduerse part, and doe seaze and take them at their going out of our Ports, which is all one in a manner, as if they tooke them within our Port, and will bee no lesse hinderance to the trade of Merchants: Our pleasure therefore and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to all our Officers and Subiects by Sea and Land, That they shall prohibite, as much as in them lyeth, all such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of Men of warre of either side, so neere the entrie of any of our Hauens or our Coastes, And that they shall rescue and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour all Merchants, and others that shall fall within the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of any such as shall await our Coastes in so neere places, to the hinderance of Trade and Traffique outward and homeward from and to our Kingdomes. And for the better instructions of our Officers in the execution of these two Articles, Wee haue caused to be sent to them plats of those Limits, within which we are resolued that these Orders shalbe obserued.</p>
               <p>And where it hath happened, and is like to doe often, that a Ship of warre of the one side may come into some of our Ports, where there shall bee a Merchant of the other side: In such case, for the benefit and preseruation of the lawfull Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Our pleasure is, That all Merchants Ships, if they will require it, shall bee suffered to depart out of the sayd Port, two or three Tydes before the Man of warre, to the intent that the Merchant may bee free from the pursuite of his aduersary. And if it so happen, that any Ship or Ships of warre of the one
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177081:57"/> side, doe finde any Ship or Ships of warre of the other side in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Ports or Roades aforesayd; Like as our pleasure is that during their abode there, all violence be forborne: So doe wee likewise commaund our sayde Officers and Subiects both on Sea and Land, That the Ship of warre which came in first, bee suffered to depart a Tyde or two before the other which came in last, And that for so long time they shall stay and detaine any ship of warre, that would offer to pursue another out of any our Ports immediatly.</p>
               <p>And where wee are infourmed, that notwithstanding the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie of our Lawes against receiuers of Pirats goods, many of our Officers of our Ports, and other inhabitants within and neere vnto them, doe receiue dayly Goods brought in from Sea by such as are indeed Pirats, if they, and the getting of their Goods, were well examined: We doe hereby admonish them all, to auoyd the receiuing or buying of any Goods from Sea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not into the Realme by lawfull course of Merchandise, for that they shall finde, wee are resolued so to preuent all occasion and encouragement of Pirats to bee vsed by any our Subiects, as wee will cause our Lawes to bee fully executed according to their true meaning, both against the Pirats, and all Receiuers and Abetters of them, and their Goods.</p>

               <p>WHereas the Kings Maiesty hath alwayes bene ready to imbrace and cherish such a perfit amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betweene him and the King of Spaine, and the Archdukes his good brethren, as might stand with his owne Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the common good of his people (For the better &amp; more particuler obseruation whereof, there hath beene lately passed a Treatie, wherein his Maiesties Royall will and pleasure is made so notorious to the world in all things, as whosoeuer doeth, or shall crosse the sinceritie of his Maiesties intention by any action of theirs, cannot auoyd the censure of high and wilfull contempt against his person and State,) Although his Maiestie is not ignorant, that these offences for the most part, are dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by such, as (partly out of their owne originall corruption, and partly by habite of spoile and rapine) are become so insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or desperate of the perill they draw vpon themselues, and the imputation they cast vpon the honour of their Soueraigne (so precious to him) as his Maiestie is driuen for repaire thereof, to make open profession of his sinceritie in this kinde, more often then otherwise he would: Neuerthelesse, his Maiestie hauing lately found by many circumstances, that most of these great faults doe growe and multiply, by negligence of inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, (especially such as are resident in the Ports, and dwell in the Maritime Counties,) from whome his Maiestie expecteth so
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177081:59"/> continuall care and vigilancie (not onely out of feare of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties displeasure, but euen for conscience sake,) as they should be rather industrious watches ouer those that runne such wicked courses, then (in any degree) Receitors or abettors of the same, considering that those are as well accomptable to God, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the euill of others (being in their power, and incident to their peculiar places and dueties) as those that are the personall Actors, or contriuers of the same: His Maiestie hath thought it necessary once again to publish to all persons of what place or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition soeuer within his Maiesties Dominions, these Rules and Ordinances following, as things whereunto he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all persons (whatsoeuer) to yeelde their duetifull obedience, vpon perill of his heauy indignation, and the grieuous paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the same.</p>
               <p>FIrst, his Maiestie commandeth that no Seaman or Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whatsoeuer, shalbe suffered to put himselfe into any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like seruice at Sea of any forreine Prince or State, straitly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all that are in any such seruice already, to leaue the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently and without delay, and to record their apparance in their natiue Countrey, to some of his Maiesties Officers, vpon paine to be held and punished as Pirates.</p>
               <p>Item, If any person offending, do at any time hereafter come into any port, or place of his Maiesties Dominions, vpon what pretext soeuer: his Maiestie expresly chargeth all his Officers forthwith to apprehend the same, and to commit them to prison without Baile or Mainprise, and the Certificate thereof to bee presently returned into the Admiraltie Court, to the end that they may be proceeded withall, according to the Lawes of the Realme, and the contents of his Maiesties former Proclamations.</p>
               <p>Item, His Maiestie commandeth all his Subiects, (as they will auoyd his heauie indignation) to forbeare to be aiding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of any Pirats, or such persons as shall continue in any such warlike seruice, as aforesaid, or any person not being a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Merchant, by contracting, buying, selling, or by vicualling of them, or any of their Companie, vpon paine for so doing, to be punished presently, as the principall Offenders and Pirates ought to be.</p>
               <p>Item, That no shipping, or men of warre, of what estate or condition soeuer, going forth with commission of reprisall, or in any other warlike maner to serue at Seas, shall bee permitted in any of his Maiesties ports, or in the members thereof to victuall or relieue themselues with any warlike prouisions, thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able themselues the better, to any acts of hostilitie at Sea against
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177081:60"/> any of his Maiesties friends: but onely in their returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if they happen to come into any of his Maiesties ports, that then it shall be lawfull for them to relieue themselues with victuall or other necessaries to serue them onely for the space of twentie dayes and no more, which is a proportion reasonable to vse in trade of merchandize.</p>
               <p>Item, That all viceadmirals, Customers, or other Officers of the Ports shall not suffer any ship of his Maiesties Subiects to goe to the Seas, before such time as they (respectiuely in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ports) haue duely searched and visited the same, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stay such persons as apparantly shall bee furnished for the warres, and not for merchandize or fishing. And if there shall be any maner of suspition, that the sayd person (though he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to trade for merchandize or fishing) hath or may haue any other intent by his prouisions or furniture, then to vse the trade of merchandise or fishing, that in such case of suspition, the officers of the Ports shall stay, and no wayes suffer the same to passe to the seas, without good bands with sufficient sureties first had, to vse nothing, but the lawfull trade of merchandise or fishing. And if the sayd officers shal suffer any persons otherwise to repaire to the Seas, then aboue is mentioned, they shall not onely answere for any Pyracies, which any such person shall chance hereafter to commit vpon the Seas, but shall suffer imprisonment vntill the offenders may be apprehended, if they shall be liuing.</p>
               <p>And further, as his Maiestie declareth and denounceth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all such Pirates and Rouers vpon the Seas to be put out of his protection, and therefore to bee lawfully pursued and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to the vttermost extremitie: so because his Maiesty presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that all other States and persons in peace and friendship with him, will thinke it iust and honourable to proceede towards him, with the same sinceritie, which he obserueth towards them: His Maiestie doeth also hereby notifie to the world, that where it falleth out that diuers of his Subiects are or may be entertained to serue at Sea vnder Captaines and Commanders belonging to some forreine Prince or State, (which are now or may bee in termes of Hostilitie with any of his Maiesties friends) thereby imagining, when they shall (vpon occasion) enter with their ships into any of his Maiesties Harboroughs, that they shall bee free from any interruption, according to the libertie of Common A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and correspondencie which is vsually obserued betweene Princes in such cases, onely because the Commander or Captaine with some few persons besides are strangers, and the rest onely discouered to be his Maiesties Subiects: For as much as his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177081:60"/> Maiestie (hauing made his iust and equall intentions thus appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all men by his publike Proclamations) would be loath to frustrate the expectation of any his friends whom it doeth or may concerne: He doth hereby declare to all the world, that if he shall hereafter finde any such fraudulent course taken, in hope colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to auoid the true construction of his so iust and necessary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the breach whereof giues cause of further trouble and iealousies to arise betweene his Maiesty and other Princes in the mutuall exercise of their Subiects free trade and entercourse: he will make absolute stay of any such ships and persons, which shalbe so brought into his Ports or Harboroughs, as persons and things wholly exempted from that protection and fauour, which he intendeth to maintaine and affoord to all others which shall not in such kind go about to abuse his Maiesties integrity, whose desire is to receiue no better measure in any thing, then he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to yeeld to others vpon the like occasions.</p>

               <p>WHereas Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, goods, chattels, money, and other things haue bene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giuen, limitted, appointed and assigned, aswell by his Maiesties most noble Progenitors, as by sundry other wel disposed persons; Some for reliefe of aged, impotent, and poore people, some for maintenance of sicke and maymed souldiers and Mariners, Schooles of learning, Free-schooles, and Schollers in Vniuersities; Some for repaire of Bridges, Ports, Hauens, Cause-wayes, Churches, Seabanks, and High-wayes; Some for education and preferment of Orphans; Some for or towards reliefe, stock, or maintenance for houses of Correction; Some for marriage of poore Maydes; Some for supportation, ayde, and helpe of yong Tradesmen, Handicrafts men, and persons decaied; And others for reliefe, or redemption of prisoners, or Captiues, and for ayd or ease of any poore inhabitants, concerning paiment of Fifteenes, setting out of Souldiers, and other Taxes: Which Lands, Tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, money, and other things neuerthelesse haue not not bene imployed according to the charitable intent of the giuers and Founders thereof, by reason of frauds, breaches of trust, and negligences in those, that should pay, deliuer, and employ the same. For redresse and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof, remedy and reliefe haue bene prouided, in and by one Act of Parliament, made in the 43. yeere of the Reigne of the late Queene of famous memory, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> late Queene of England. By the due execution of which Act, in diuers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of this Realme, much good hath ensued, by the diligence and traueile of diuers of our charitable and well affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by restoring, and true employing of diuers and many of the said Gifts and Endowments, according to the true institution, ordinance, and intention of the Founders and donors in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: And much more good his Maiestie dayly expecteth should be done in so Religious a case, acceptable to God and al good men.</p>
               <p>And whereas such as haue the care, charge and gouernment of the Colledges, Halles, and houses of learning within either of the Vniuersities of Cambridge or Oxeford, or of the Colleges of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, Eaton, or Winchester, or of any Cathedrall or Collegiate Church, were presumed by the makers of the said Act, in respect
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:177081:61"/> of their professions and Offices (which ought to put them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall memory of their dueties) to need no Law to enforce them to the performance of so iust and charitable a worke, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did by special Prouiso except and exempt them out of the said Act: His most excellent Maiestie, in his godly meditations, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to his blessed remembrance, how good and necessary it is, That the deuout, godly, and charitable intents of the said Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and giuers should be exactly and duely performed, And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting, but that the sayd persons, bodies Politique and Corporate so excepted, will aswell in discharge of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences (albeit they be not bound by the said Act) as for example to all others (that may be enforced thereby) wil speedily, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly, and exactly performe their said duety: Yet lest that any in so great a number should be found either so remisse, as to neglect the speedie employment of the same, or so vncharitable and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable, as in any sort, by fraude or deuises to seeke to peruert or ouerthrow the true institution and meaning of the sayd Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Giuers; His most excellent Maiestie, in his Princely and Royall care, That the sayd good and godly vses and intents may be duely and speedily employed, as is abouesayd, And that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons bodies Politike or Corporate (presuming to passe away with impunitie) neglect, or not performe their dueties in that behalfe, Doeth (by aduise of his Priuie Councell) straitly charge and command aswell all and singuler person and persons, bodies Politike and Corporate, within either of the sayd Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of Cambridge or Oxeford, or within Westminster, Eaton, or Winchester, or any Cathedrall or Collegiate Church aforesaid, as all other person and persons, bodies Politique and Corporate whatsoeuer hauing any Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, profits, goods, chattels, summes of money, or other things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be giuen, limited, assigned or appointed to or for any of the good and charitable vses abouesaid, That they and euery of them doe wel and faithfully imploy the said Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Goods, Chattels, summes of money or other things, according to the true meaning, ordinance, and institution of the Founders, or giuers of the same, vpon paine of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties high displeasure, and of such penalties and punishments, as they shall iustly deserue for contemning of his Royall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a cause so iust and necessary to be performed, and for their demerits in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>And albeit his Maiesty knoweth, that for and concerning such person and persons, bodies politique and Corporate as be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the said Act, such sufficient remedy and reformation by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:177081:62"/> visitations, and other lawfull meanes may be had in the cases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid: Yet forasmuch as these proceedings will require time, and draw the parties exempted out of the said Act, from their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and exercises of learning, and put them to no small charge; His most excellent Maiestie, hath for their ease and profit taken this more speedy course by these presents in maner and forme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesayd; Giuing all and singuler the person and persons, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Politique and Corporate abouesayd assuredly to know, That whosoeuer shall violate, or not performe his Maiesties Royall commandement hereby published, that he, or they, or any of them shall not hope to passe away with impunity, but shall vndergoe such paines, penalties, and punishments, as by the seuerity of the Lawes of this Realme, may be inflicted and imposed vpon so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and vncharitable offendours.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation, against certaine calumnious surmises concerning the Church gouernment of Scotland.</head>
               <p>WHereas we haue euer since it pleased God to establish vs in the Imperial Crowne of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> equally regarded the good of both the late Kingdomes of Scotland and England, now happily vnited in our Royal person in one Monarchie, euer minding to maintaine and continue the good and lowable customes and Lawes whereby each of them hath bene these many ages so worthily gouerned: neuerthelesse some malitious spirits, enemies to that common tranquilitie so much desired by vs (forgetting the many proofes both publique and priuate, which we haue giuen of that our gratious affection to that our natiue and ancient countrey of <hi>North Britaine.</hi> of the freedome, libertie and priuiledges whereof we haue at all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken so speciall a patrociny, as the solemne assemblies of the Estates of <hi>South Britaine,</hi> and Commissioners from the Estates of both Kingdoms haue bene eye witnesses) haue not bene ashamed to labour to peruert the minds of our best affected subiects, That whereas the insolent and factious cariage of some of them hath merited most seuere animaduersion, they would insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the commiseration of the multitude, by assuming vnto them a glorious profession of the maintaining of the Priuiledges
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:177081:62"/> and auctorized discipline, intended by vs (as they affirme) to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowne by a sudden and vnseasonable laying vpon them at this present the Rites, Ceremonies, and whole Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall order established in the Church of this part of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Britaine.</hi> And as we haue euer carefully regarded how conuenient it is to maintaine euery Countrey in that forme of gouernment which is fittest and can best agree with the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and how dangerous alterations are without good aduice and mature deliberation, &amp; that euen in matters of order of the Church, in some small Ilands vnder our Dominions, wee haue abstained from suffering any alteration: So doubt we not, but our good Subiects will neuer be that credulous contrary to the knowen trueth, which hath euer appeared clearely in all our Actions, as to be in any doubt, but as in all our proceedings wee haue bene a Patrone of Religion and Iustice, (two inseparable conseruers of all Monarchies,) So hath all our study and care euer bene to retrench and reforme all courses that caried any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to that integritie whereat we haue euer aymed, and as by so many good Lawes set forth in our gouernment, Iustice hath attained to another perfection and splendor, then it had in any our predecessors times, and with painefull and vnpleasant busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wee haue in the discipline of the Church taken away innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable abuses and corruptions, which if they had not bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, had brought the puritie of Religion in extreeme danger. Yet we hope that none dare be so impudent as to affirme that by our Soueraigne power, or absolute commandement we did the same (although we enioyed our auctoritie as freely as any King or Monarch of the world) but as the disease of the Ciuil body was euer cured by the aduise of our three Estates, So the defects of the Church by the helpe and counsell of those who had greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in them, So as the presumption of our by-gone actions in our administration, whiles we were present, the proofe of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care towards this part of our kingdome since our residence here, may be sufficient to secure vs against all such malitious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations. And how euer in rule of pollicie we cannot but iudge it conuenient that two estates so inseparably conioyned, should be drawen to as great conformitie in al things as the good of both may permit; And that no Monarchy either in Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall pollicie hath yet attained to that perfection, that it needs no reformation, or that infinite occasions may not arise whereupon wise Princes will foresee for the benefite of their States, iust cause of alteration: Yet are we and haue euer bene resolued, not to make any sudden or hasty change in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:177081:63"/> of that part of our Kingdome, either Ciuil or Ecclesiastical, but with graue aduice and consent of our Estates, and the wisest and best sort of them whom it most properly concerns, much lesse to trouble them with any vnnecessary alteration of indifferent and Ceremoniall matters, and that vpon such foreseene aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and preuention of confusion and euill to come, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enemies of all Peace, obedience to Princes, and order in all gouernments shal not obtrude any inconuenient to the contrary. And as by Gods holy assistance, we haue drawen that part of our Kingdome out of infinite troubles, factions, and cruel barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reduced the vttermost borders and confines thereof to Gods obedience, and acknowledging of our Lawes; (an Estate neuer heard of before, since this Iland hath bene inhabited) So by the same diuine prouidence and our fatherly care ouer the whole Iland, we intend to transmit the same in good order, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py quietnesse, and flourishing pollicie to that posteritie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath blessed vs, and after them to the worlds end; Like as for the more verification of our Honourable intention, and to stop the mouthes of these vnquiet spirits, raisers of that false scandall of alteration, We haue appointed a generall assembly to be holden at <hi>Dundee</hi> the last Tuesday of Iuly, whereat we expect reparation of those disorders in so farre as belongeth to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to be freed in time comming of all such calumnies.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch as it appeareth now in part, who were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of <hi>Percy</hi> in his detestable Treason published by our former Proclamations, in their assembling together to moue our people to Rebellion, Although perhaps many of them did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderstand the secret and depth of his abhominable purpose; and that amongst those which do flee for feare of our power, and for the guiltinesse of their offence, Wee are informed that the sayd <hi>Percy</hi> is: Wee haue thought it good to make knowen to all men, both that we put great odds betweene his part of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and other mens; And also, that forasmuch as it importeth greatly that he should be taken, to the end that by his confessions, the whole plot and the partners thereof might be discouered, and from himselfe the horrible purpose opened, which it is likely that many whom he hath seduced did neuer vnderstand, And also that by the exemplary punishment of him, others be terrified frÅ such Treasons, as tend not onely to our destruction, but to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and vtter dissolution of the State: If any person shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the said <hi>Percy,</hi> and bring him to vs or any our Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue; if that person be an offendour and paxtner with him in his Treason in whatsoeuer degree, we will not onely giue him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his life, lands, and goods, but also bestow on him a reward of the value of one Thousand pounds at the least. And if he be no offendor, yet shall he haue that or a greater reward. And for their assurance we doe hereby giue our pricely word.</p>

               <p>SVch is the zeale and inward affection which we haue found in all sorts of our louing and loyall Subiects of this our Kingdome, as we are content to acknowledge, that (besides
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177081:69"/> the Christian care which all Kings are bound by the Law of God and nature to take ouer all their people) our owne sence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of their complaints, doeth dayly increase with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we haue of their honest merits. In which respect, hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some more particular paines in the examination of diuers circumstances, then is common to many princes; we did not only command all our Officers to be very diligent to trie out and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the offences of Purueyours with all seueritie, but to fall into serious consideration, how all occasion may bee taken away here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, whereby those inferiour Ministers, which are vsed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, may make themselues (vnder colour of our prerogatiue royal) the instruments of corruption and rapine: A matter most odious to our owne nature, who haue alwayes more desire to giue then to receiue from any our Subiects, except it be where necessitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth vs thereunto, euen for the support and preseruation of that state and dignitie wherein Almightie God hath placed vs. For better assurance whereof, We haue thought it very conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at this time, to take some occasion in this maner to expresse the fruits of our care and consideration concerning this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point of Purueyances.</p>
               <p>FIrst, when wee were informed that some inferiour ministers had presumed to goe so farre beyond their Commission, as they haue aduentured not onely to take timber trees growing (which being parcell of our Subiects inheritance were neuer intended by vs to be taken) without the good will and full contentment of the Owners, but haue accustomed also to take vp farre greater quantities of prouisions for our house and stable, then euer came or were needfull for our vse (as most especially in wood, coale, hay, and cariage vpon our Progresse iourneys or remoues:) Although we haue no cause to doubt, but that our Officers of our Green-cloth haue bene and will be euer most ready to search out and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all such offences vpon iust complaints, Yet we did not leaue the pursuit and triall thereof to them onely, but did particularly direct our Attorney generall to informe against them on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe in our Court of Starre-chamber, where some of them vpon their confession, haue already receiued (by censure of that Court) condigne punishment by Fine, imprisonment, pillorie, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of their eares, And some others seeking to saue themselues by denying that wherewith they were charged, doe still remaine vnder examination to receiue the like punishment, vpon due proofe thereof to be made against them. By which example wee perswade our selues, that all honest men will rest so well assured of our good intention to reforme abuses (euen to their greatest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177081:69"/> when there is iust occasion) as they will carefully and willingly. continue their obedience and conformitie to those cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for furnishing such prouisions as are necessary for vs which were taken by the consent of most of the principall Gentlemen, and good Patriots in seuerall Counties, And whereof aboue six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Shires haue had continuance by the space of forty yeeres, Especially considering how many good, and wise Princes of this Realme, that haue gone before vs, where such agreements haue not bin made, haue held themselues to their right of purueyance, which is one of the most ancient flowers of the Crowne in our Progenitors, and must descend to our posteritie, whom God (we hope) both hath, and will so farre enable with his blessings, and graces, as they shall prooue themselues no lesse able, nor worthy then any others, to enioy and preserue the right, of a iust and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Monarchie. Wherein, because all wise men knowe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that wheresoeuer there must be a trust in vulgar persons, it is not possible to keepe their actions from errors, and abuses; We haue thought it fit for a further demonstration of our great care to preuent the same, to publish that which followeth, as well to terrifie the euil, as to comfort the well affected, whose iust griefe shall euer lie as neere vs, as our owne.</p>
               <p>BE it therefore knowen hereby, that we doe giue expresse charge and commandement, that none of our Purueyours, nor other of our Officers or ministers whatsoeuer, that now are, or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall be, or any of them, or any of their deputies or seruants, shall take for vs, or in our name, or to or for any vse whatsoeuer, any timber trees of any our Subiects, growing in any place, or places whatsoeuer, without the expresse consent, and agreement of the owner thereunto had and obtained. Of which particular abuses we cannot conceale our mislike, both in respect of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie done thereby to that laudable policie of the Realme for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of timber, &amp; also in the particular feeling we haue in our own affections how grieuous it is for any man to behold y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fruits, and honest pleasures of his owne labors or his ancestors, defaced and spoiled by the lewde &amp; rauenous malice of base companions.</p>
               <p>SEcondly, because we haue considered that our Subiects may be sometime ouer burthened (against the meaning of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Officers) by the vnreasonable taking of wood, coale, hay, oats and such like prouisions in time of progresse: We do expresly charge and command all our Officers, ministers, or any of their deputies and seruants, to forbeare to take either wood, coale, hay, or oats in larger proportion, then shall bee found necessary to bee expended for the Seruice of our house and stable.</p>

               <p>ANd We doe in like manner expresly prohibite and forbid all persons, after the end of this Session of Parliament, to make and Purueyance without Commission for euery seuerall Shire, containing the kindes, and quantities (so neere as may bee) which they are to puruey in such a Shire. And that to the same Commissions blanke Scedules bee annexed, which cannot bee taken off, wherein they shall truely, in presence of such high Constable, or Constables, pettie Constable, or Constables, Headborough, or Headboroughes, as shall (by precept to him or them directed) bee priuie to the deliuery of any the prouisions in the sayd Commission specified, enter their takings presently, whereunto the sayde Constable, &amp;c. shall subscribe their names or signe Manuell.

               <p>ANd for the better satisfaction of our people, of whose loyaltie and inward affections we stand so much assured, as they will not repine at any prouision deliuered by vertue of our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it may appeare to come to our vse, our wil &amp; pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that our Iustices of Peace in euery seuerall County or Countrey where any prouision shalbe taken by vertur of our Commissions, shall at their quarter Sessions take particular reckning of the high and pettie Constables of all warrants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto them from any minister of ours, together with what prouisions or carriages they haue deliuered vnto them by vertue of our Commission, the true and iust Certificate whereof they shal halfe yeerely at the least, vnder the hands and Seales of some of them certifie to our Treasurer and Comptroller, or other our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of <hi>Greencloth,</hi> who presently by the parcels and accompts of our house shall duely examine the receit from such Purueyors. And if it be found by Certificate of the said Iustices or otherwise, that they haue taken more then they haue deliuered for our vse or expence, vnlesse it shall appeare to haue had iust cause of miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way: then we require our Officers of Houshold, vpon paine of our displeasure, without delay to send the party so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the County where such offence or offences shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there to receiue punishment of life and member as the good and ancient Lawes of our Realme haue formerly ordeined and appointed.</p>
               <p>FVrthermore, as we did in our returne out of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> being our first progresse, vpon the examination of some abuses, draw downe the number of our carriages to such a proportion as two full third parts was diminished of the numbers before time vsed: euen so at this time, because we conceiue that the matter of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages is the greatest grieuance, And that it is oftentimes no lesse trouble to our people to come emptie with their carts to Court to take in carriages, then to conuey them; We doe therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also command all persons vsed in the seruice of Cart-taking for our remoues, to forbeare to take either more carriages then are of necessitie to be vsed, or to warne or charge carts in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Towne, Burrow, or hundred aboue fourteene miles at any time distant from the place where they are to receiue their loding, vpon paine of loosing their Office and Seruice, and such further punishment as is to be inflicted vpon them for their contempts. And we doe likewise require all high Constables, vpon receipt of any Warrants from any our Cart-takers, their seruants or depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for warning of Carts within their hundreds, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not to warne any but in such part of the hundreth as shalbe

               <p>FVrther, wee charge and commaund the Purueiors of our Woodyard and Scullary, vpon taking of any proportion of Wood or coale for our prouision, not to medle or assume authority vnto themselues for warning any Carts for carriage of the same, but by direction of two at the least of our Iustices of Peace next adioyning of that County, where such Wood, or coales shalbe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to the end the same may be performed with the greatest ease to our louing Subiects, vpon paine of loosing their Office, and such further punishment, as their contempt shall require: Not doubting, but those Iustices, which are made priuy to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, wil vse such care, and expedition at all times, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of our seruice, and for the good and quiet of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as wee shall not be forced by their remisnesse, to returne the wonted authoritie into the hands of the Purueyors.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation, charging all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, Seminaries &amp;c. to depart the land.</head>
               <p>WE doe not doubt but that all our Subiects (embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Religion professed in this Church of England, &amp; by Law established within this Realme) are throughly perswaded of our constant resolution for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and defence of the same; Not onely because we found it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:177081:72"/> here so many yeeres setled, and blessed of God in the long peace and prosperity of our people, wherewith it hath bene accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied since the first setting the same free from the <hi>Romish</hi> seruitude, But also and chiefly, because our owne knowledge and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (illuminated by the Spirit of God) doeth assure vs that the same is agreeable to his Diuine word, and to the doctrine of the Primitiue Church. Of which our purpose and determination, besides all other our former proceedings (since our entry into this kingdome) we haue giuen a new and certaine demonstration by our consent to such two Acts, as haue bene passed in this Session of our Parliament, both tending to preuent the dangers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the number of those, who adhering to the profession of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are blindly led (together with the superstition of their Religion) both into some points of doctrine, which cannot consist with the loyaltie of Subiects towards their Prince, and oft times into direct actions of Conspiracies and coniurations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State wherein they liue, as hath most notoriously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the late most horrible and almost incredible Coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to blow vp vs, our children, and all the three Estates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament assembled. All which notwithstanding, and although by these late Treasons aboue mentioned, contriued and pursued (as they haue bene) with the priuitie and warrant of so many of the principall Priests of that profession, &amp; grounded vpon points of doctrine, (in that Church held and mainteined) there is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause (if there had neuer bene any other enterprise vpon the same ground) to iustifie the proceedings of vs and our said Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the making and execution of these last, and all other former Statutes, tending to the same end: Neuerthelesse, seeing the Soueraigne care appertaineth to vs, who haue the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of Iustice in our hand, and the supreme dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of clemencie, and moderation of the seueritie of our Lawes is likewise as proper to vs to vse, whensoeuer we shall finde it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, the same deseruing to be no lesse allowed in vs (being in our Dominions Gods Lieutenant) then it is praised in him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whose highest Titles it is, That <hi>his Mercy is aboue all his workes:</hi> Although both Natures iust offence might be excused, if we suffered our selfe to be transported with such passions, as so vile and barbarous prouocations do excite in humane sense, And our prouidence would be also commended, if we did with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence indeuour to extirpate out of our Realme, not onely such as were guilty of the attempt, but all others that gaue any cause to be suspected of bearing fauour to it, or of whom there is any iust occasion to conceiue that they may be corrupted with the like poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:177081:72"/> Yet cannot any prouocation or other respect, extinguish in vs so vtterly the exercise of that clemencie, whereunto Nature hath so farre inclined vs, as we can be withholden from renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some course of lenitie againe in some particulars, so farre foorth as it may be without the perill of our Religious and loyall people, that concurre with vs in the profession of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And therefore to the end we might not haue any further sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ministred vnto vs, whereby we must be prouoked to execute Iustice vpon those, who (being called Religious persons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in diuers orders of their Church, as Priests, Iesuits, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, and such like) haue not onely declared themselues to be the stirrers vp of our people to disobedience, But when we were pleased formerly out of our meere Grace to signifie our Royall pleasure for their departure out of this Realme vnpunished, haue few or none of them taken hold of our Gracious fauour, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and (as it were) in scorne of the penalties which our iust Lawes could impose, haue still continued their former practises, and contempt in their returnes: As we doe purpose to send away out of our Realme euen those of that condition, whose liues are in our hands to take euery houre, if we were so disposed, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely those that are guilty of that horrible Treason;) So we haue once againe resolued, and for the last warning doe denounce it by these presents, (according to the tenor of our Lawes, and our former Proclamations) That they shall all of them, that is to say, Iesuits, Seminaries, Friers, or any other Priest whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, Regular or Secular, being made by authority of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> depart out of this Realme of England and Wales, before the first day of August next ensuing, vpon paine to incurre the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost danger of our said Lawes. And for their better meanes to depart according to this our pleasure, we doe hereby signifie to them, That if at any time before the said first day of August, they or any of them, excepting <hi>Gerrard</hi> or <hi>Greenwell,</hi> shall resort to any Port Towne of our Realme, and there declare himselfe to the Magistrate of the said Towne, or other Officers of our Port, that he is a Priest of any sort whatsoeuer, and that he is there to take shipping for his passage, they shall suffer him or them quietly to depart, and shal see them shipped and sent away, and giue them therein furtherance for their departure.</p>
               <p>And because there may be some Priests in hold in diuers parts of our Realme, not yet knowen to vs, We doe will and command all Sheriffes, Bayliffes, and Keepers of prisons, within twentie dayes after the publishing of this Proclamation, to aduertise our Priuie Counsell, or some of them, of the names of all such priests,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:177081:73"/> Iesuits, Seminaries, or of any other sort that are in their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by whom, and for what cause they were committed, to the end that thereupon we may giue order for their transportation.</p>
               <p>And now least happily this vnexpected course of our so oft rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated clemencie after such an example, should either serue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Priests themselues to affront our Iustice, or discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage those good and deare Subiects of ours, whose danger and destruction wee know shall neuer bee seuered from our owne, whensoeuer any such Proiects shall be in motion; We doe hereby protest, that this is done with no other purpose, but to auoyd the effusion of blood, and by banishing them presently out of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, to remoue all cause of such seueritie, as we shall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be constrained to vse towards the other sort of our people, as long as those Seducers shall haue opportunitie to betray their consciences, and corrupt their loyaltie, towards whom our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe so vary with the Obiect, as we confesse, that we desire still to make it appeare in the whole course of our Gouernment, that we are farre from accompting all those Subiects disloyall, that are that way affected, and that we doe distinguish of such as be caried onely with blinde Zeale, and such as sinne out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and vnder pretext of zeale make it their onely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation to perswade disobedience, and to practise the ruine of this Church and Common-wealth. And therefore as after times must giue vs triall of all mens behauiour, so must all men expect that their owne deserts must be the onely measure of their fortunes at our hands, either one way or other.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177081:74"/> the first, and of Scotland the seuen and thirtieth; It was amongst other things enacted, That no woman nor any childe vnder the age of one and twenty yeeres (except Sailers or Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, or Apprentice, or Factor of some merchant in trade of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize) should be permitted to passe ouer the Seas, except the same should be by licence of vs, our Heires or Successors, or some sixe or more of our Priuy Councel, thereunto first had vnder their hands, vpon paine that the Officers of the Port that should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or negligently suffer any such to passe, or should not enter the names of such Passengers licensed, should forfeite his Office, and all his goods and chattels, And vpon paine that the Owner of any Ship or Vessell, that should wittingly or willingly carie any such ouer the Seas, without licence as is aforesayd, should forfeit his Ship or Vessell, and all the tackle, And euery master or mariner, of or in any such Ship or Vessell, offending as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd, should forfeit all their goods, and suffer imprisonment by the space of twelue moneths without Baile, or Maineprise, As by the sayd Acte of Parliament amongst other things may more at large appeare:</p>

               <p>THe Kings most excellent Maiestie, finding that the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plague is at this present in sundry places of the Citie of London, and neere adioyning to the same, though not (God be thanked) with the mortalitie of great numbers; yet so dispersed in diuers of the best and most open streets of the sayd Citie, as doe giue iust cause to doubt, that the contagion thereof, by great resort of people, might be further spread, aswell in the Citie, as into other parts of the Realme, whereby both danger might ensue to his Royall Person, the Queene his dearest wife, and his children, and to his most louing Subiects repairing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Suits and causes, and likewise by such increase of the infection, if it should happen (which God forbid) the next Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Highnesse Parliament, appoynted for the great and waightie affaires of the Realme, might be prorogued: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, for these necessary considerations, and hoping that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will, by the goodnesse of Almightie God, with the coldnes of the yeere, and such wholesome Orders as are taken in his sayd Citie, the rather cease by the adiournement of part of this next Terme of S. Michael now at hand, from the <hi>Vtas</hi> of the same, vntill the fourth Returne of the sayd Terme called <hi>Mense Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ã«lis</hi> next comming. His Maiestie therefore, of his speciall fauour and clemencie, is pleased and contented, to adiourne the sayde Terme of S. Michael, that is to say, From the <hi>Vtas</hi> thereof, vnto the said fourth Returne of the sayd Terme, called <hi>Mense MichaÃ«lis</hi> next comming; Which his Maiesty signifieth to all and singular his louing Subiects of this his Realme, to the intent that they and euery of them, which hath cause or commandement to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in any of his Highnesse Courts at Westminster, in or at any day or time from and after the said <hi>Vtas</hi> of S.

And neuerthelesse his Maiesties pleasure is, That two of his Iustices, that is to say, of either Bench one, shall the first day of Michaelmas Terme, called <hi>Octabis MichaÃ«<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> according to the ancient order of the Lawes, keepe the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soignes

And the sayd adiournement shall be made in the first day of the sayd <hi>Vtas,</hi> commonly called, the day of Essoignes. And further his Maiesties pleasure is, That all matters, causes and Suits, depending in any of his other Courts betweene partie and partie, as in his Highnesse Courts of Chancery, Starchamber, and Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, Duchy of Lancaster, and Court of Requests, shall haue continuance, and the parties shall haue day from the date of these presents, vntill the saide fourth Returne, as before is sayd.</p>
               <p>Prouided alway, and his Maiesties pleasure and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That all Collectors, Receiuers, Sheriffes, and other Accomptants, and all other persons, that should or ought to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt or pay any summe or summes of money in any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, and of his Duchie of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Accompt in any of the sayd Courts, shall repaire vnto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed places at Westminster, where his Highnesse hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed such Officers and ministers, as for that purpose his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie hath thought expedient, and there to pay and doe in euery behalfe, as though no such Proclamation of adiournement had bene had or made. And his Highnesse further pleasure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is, That all Sheriffes shall returne their Writs and Proces against all such Accomptants and Debtors, at the dayes therein appointed. And if any person or persons, who ought to accompt or pay any summe or summes of money to his Maiestie in any of the Courts and places aforesaid, doe make default there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, That then his Highnesse Writs and Proces shall be awarded and sent foorth against euery such person and persons, and the same to be duely &amp; orderly serued, and returned by the Sheriffes and Officers thereunto appoynted, in such like maner and forme, as the same should haue beene, if this present Proclamation had not bene made.

               <p>Wherefore, wee will and command all Lieutenants, deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Bailiffes, Headboroughs, Constables, and all other our Officers and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to whom it may appertaine, if the said persons shal continue so assembled after Proclamation made, or any such new Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies be gathered in those, or any other parts of our Realme, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to suppresse them by whatsoeuer meanes they may, be it by force of Armes, if admonitions and other lawfull meanes doe not serue to reduce them to their dueties. For we cannot but be iustly moued to such seueritie against those, who vniustly throw a slander vpon our gouernment, by taking that pretence for their disobedience: Seeing it is manifest by Act of Parliament, passed since our comming to this Crowne, that we haue bene carefull to preuent such Enclosures, and Depopulations, and that it hath bene an ordinary charge giuen by vs to our Iustices of Assises,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:177081:77"/> when they went to their Circuits, to enquire of all vnlawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populations and Enclosures, and to take order to remedy the same, and to punish the Offenders therein according to the due course of Law.

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation signifying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties pleasure aswell for suppressing of riotous Assemblies about Inclosures, as for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Depopulations.</head>
               <p>IT is a thing notorious that many of the meanest sort of our people in diuers parts of our Kingdome, either by secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, wrought by some wicked instruments, or by ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the first beginners, haue presumed lately to assemble themselues riotously in multitudes, and being armed with sundry weapons, haue layd open in forcible manner a great quantitie of seuerall mens possessions, some newly inclosed, and others of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance, making their pretence that some townes haue bene depopulated, and diuers families vndone by meanes of such Enclosures. In which seditious courses they haue persisted not onely after many prohibitions by our Ministers in the seuerall Counties, but after particular Proclamations published by our Royall Authoritie, and which is more, when so many meanes of lenitie and gentlenes were offered to reclaime them, as no prince would haue vsed, but such a one as was both confident in the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affections of his Subiects in generall, and compassionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177081:77"/> the simplicitie of such Offenders: many of them stood out most obstinately, and in open field rebelliously resisted such forces as in our Name, and by our Authoritie came to represse them, whereupon insued by necessitie in the end that some blood was drawen as well by martiall execution, as by ciuill iustice.</p>
               <p>Vpon this accident it seemeth good vnto Vs to declare to the world, and specially to our louing Subiects, as well that which concerneth our affections (which vpon seuerall respects are diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betweene comfort and griefe) as that which concerneth also our Princely intentions, which likewise are bent vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary obiects and courses of grace and iustice. For first of all wee find cause of comfort in our selues in regard of the clearenesse of our conscience (to whome God hath committed the care and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouenment of our people) from giuing cause or colour of such complaint; the matter whereof is such, as we take our selues more interessed therein then any our Subiects can bee: For as we cannot but know, that the glory and strength of all Kings consisteth in the multitude of Subiects, so may wee not forget that it is a special and peculiar preheminence of those Countreys, ouer which God hath placed vs, that they doe excell in breeding and nourishing of able and seruiceable people, both for warre and peace, which we doe iustly esteeme aboue all treasure and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which our sayd Dominions doe otherwise so plentifully yeeld vnto vs. Neither in this particular case of depopulation, can any man make doubt but it must be farre from our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to suffer any tolleration of that which may be any occasion to decay or diminish our people, if we did consider nothing else, but that vse and application which we may make (as other Princes doe) both of the bodies of our people to carry armes for defence of our Crowne, and of their goods and substance to supply our wants vpon all iust and reasonable occasions, so as wee may by many reasons sufficiently iustifie our care herein towards God and the world (forasmuch as appertaineth to our Kingly Office) seeing the sayd Inclosures (lawfull or vnlawfull) were all or the most part made before we had taken the Scepter of this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into our possession. Whereunto wee may adde (as wholy cleansing and washing our hands from the tolleration of these grieuances) the continuall and strict charges &amp; commandements giuen by vs to our Iudges and Iustices, for the care and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those things which may be in any wise grieuous to our people in their seuerall Countreys, although in this point there is some defence alledged by our subordinate Ministers, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Iustices of Assise, that our people haue bene wanting
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177081:78"/> to themselues in the due and ordinary meanes which they ought to take, by presentment of such as are or haue bene guiltie of these oppressions. But as we take comfort that the causes of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints haue not proceeded from our gouernment, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise (before these seditious courses first brake foorth) taken into our Princely consideration this matter of depopulating and decaying of Townes and families (whereof we are more sensible, then any other) with resolution to cure whatsoeuer is amisse, by iust and orderly remedies: So are we grieued to behold what the disloyaltie and obstinacie of this rebellious people hath forced vs vnto, who being naturally inclined to spare shedding of blood, could haue wished that the humble and voluntary submission and repentance of all those Offenders, might both haue preuented the losse of the life of any one of them, and the example of Iustice vpon some might haue preuented the losse of more. And seeing it was of such necessitie, that some in regard of their intollerable obstinacie in so pernicious Treason should perish, rather then the sparkes of such a fire in our Kingdome should be left vnquenched, that it may yet serue to put others in mind of their duetie, and saue them from the like ruine and destruction, for such and so traiterous attempts hereafter: In all which considerations, for that which may concerne our Royall intention, as wee would haue all men know and conceiue, that neither the pretence of any wrongs receiued, nor our great mislike of depopulation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, can in any wise stay vs any longer, from a seuere and iust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of such as shall take vpon them to be their owne iudges and reformers, either in this or any other pretended grieuance: So on the other side, we are not minded that the offences of a few (though iustly prouoking our Royall indignation) shall alter our gracious disposition to giue reliefe in this case, where it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth, were it for none other cause then in respect of so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers our good and louing Subiects, which might haue alledged like cause of griefe, and neuerthelesse haue contained themselues in their due obedience.</p>
               <p>And therefore we doe first declare and publish our Princely reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that if any of our subiects shall hereafter vpon pretences of the same or like grieuances, either persist in the vnlawfull and rebellious Act already begun, or renew and breake forth into the like, in any parts of our Kingdome; We will preferre the safetie, quiet, and protection of our Subiects in generall, and of the body of our State, before the compassion of any such Offenders, bee they more or lesse, and howsoeuer misled: and must forget our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall clemencie by pursuing them with all seuerity for their so
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:177081:78"/> hainous treasons, as well by our Armes as Lawes, knowing well, that wee are bound (as the head of the politike body of our Realme) to follow the course which the best phisitians vse in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diseases, which is, by a sharpe remedie applied to a small &amp; infected part, to saue the whole from dissolution &amp; destruction. To which end we doe accordingly charge &amp; command all our Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, deputy lieutenants, sheriffes, Iustices of peace, &amp; al other Magistrates of Iustice vnder vs, and all other our louing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to whom it shall any wayes appertaine, to doe and imploy their vttermost indeauors and forces for the keeping of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in peace and obedience, for preuention of all such riotous and rebellious Assemblies, and destroying them, (if any doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, or shall happen to arise) by force of Armes, and by execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (euen to present death) of such as shall make resistance.</p>
               <p>On the other side we doe notifie and declare to all our louing Subiects, That we are resolued, not out of any apprehension or regard of these tumults and disorders (which we know well to be onely dangerous to those that attempt them, and which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may teach them, that they are in a moment to be dispersed) nor to satisfie disobedient people, be they rich or poore: But meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of loue of Iustice, Christian compassion of other of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, who being likewise touched with this griefe, auoyded the like offences, As also out of our Princely care and prouidence to preserue our people from decay or diminution, to cause the abuses of Depopulations and vnlawfull Inclosures to be further loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into, and by peaceable and orderly meanes to establish such a reformation thereof, as shalbe needfull for the iust reliefe of those that haue iust cause to complaine, and therein neglect no remedy, which either the Lawes of our Realme doe prescribe, or our owne Royall Authority, with the aduice of our Councell can supply.</p>
               <p>For which purpose we haue already assembled our Iudges, and giuen them in charge straitly, to make it one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cares aswell to discouer the sayd offences, as to consider how farre they may be touched in Law, and in what course, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to proceed against them with all seueritie. And yet because the execution thereof requireth some time, though no more then must of necessitie be employed therein, if any turbulent or sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits by their impatience, or through their desire to satisfie their owne wicked humors, by moouing common troubles shall seeke to preuent the course of Iustice by any such vnlawfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as haue bene lately vsed, and abusing our gracious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position shall take the presumption to be Reformers of the said in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience by any force, because they perceiue hereby how much
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:177081:79"/> we mislike of it: We do once againe denounce vnto them the same seuere punishment, which belongeth to Rebels in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, And doe require all and euery our Magistrates, Officers and ministers of Iustice (according to their place of authoritie) and all our loyall Subiects according to their duety of assistance (laying aside all slackenesse or fond pitie) to see it duely put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: As on the other side we doe promise, and are resolued gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to lend our eares to humble and iust complaints, and to affoord our people Iustice and fauour both in this and all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fit for a King to doe for his good Subiects in generall and in particular.</p>

And yet his Maiestie (whose care doeth euer watch ouer the weale of his Subiects) considering that the principall duetie and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of al his Subiects, doeth chiefly consist to attend at all times the seruice and defence of their naturall Liege Lord, and of their deare and natiue Countrey, with all cheerefull readinesse and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie, either within the Realme, or without, when they shalbe thereunto required: And foreseeing in his Princely prouidence and wisedome what danger (especially in these dangerous daies) might insue to the whole State, if his Subiects might at their pleasure passe and depart out of this Realme into the Kingdoms, Countreys, Dominions and territories of forreine Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, States and potentates, hath vpon mature deliberation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided remedy for the preuention of such mischiefe as might follow thereupon: And therefore his Maiesty doeth (according to his Maiesties Lawes and the resolution of his Iudges, with whom consultation hath bene had, and agreeable to diuers Presidents in the reignes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, &amp; King <hi>Edward</hi> the third (two most prudent and renowmed Kings) and other of his noble Progenitors before the making of the sayd late Act by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents with the aduice of his Priuy Councell,) straitly prohibite and forbid all maner of persons being naturall borne Subiects of this Realme, or any of the Dominions of the same, of what estate or degree soeuer they be, that they of any of them (other then such persons as were excepted in and by the sayd Act, and other then Souldiers, Merchants, Mariners, and their Factors and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices) shall not any time hereafter without speciall licence of his Maiesty, or of any foure or more of his Priuy Councel (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the principall Secretary for the time being to be one) passe or depart out of this Realme of England, or any of the dominions of the same, into the Kingdomes, Countreys, territories or domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any forreine King, Prince, State, or Potentate, vpon such corporall and other great and heauy paines and penalties as by our Lawes may be inflicted vpon such as shall offend therein, for their so heinous and vnnaturall offences against their naturall Liege Lord and Countrey in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Prouided alwayes, that if any of the persons before excepted, shall after his departure out of this Realme, doe, commit, put in vre, attempt, or assent vnto any Act, deuice, plot, or thing against his most Excellent Maiesty, or any of his Kingdomes or domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177081:80"/> or against any of his Lawes or Statutes, that euery such person so offending, shal lose the benefite of the said exception, and shall to all intents and purposes be taken and adiudged to be as one that maliciously and contemptuously passeth or departeth out of this Realme contrary to the tenour and effect of these presents.</p>
               <p>And whereas by errour and vulgar opinion it is conceiued and giuen out by some, That all men at this present be at liberty to transport and carry out of this Realme any Golde or Siluer in Coyne, Iewels, Bullion, Plate or Vessell, His Maiesty vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof, caused the Iudges of the Realme to be consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withall in that point; who vpon due consideration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had amongst them, haue with one consent resolued, that the transportation of all maner of Golde and Siluer in Coyne, Iewels, Bullion, Plate or Vessell is absolutely prohibited and forbidden as well by the Statutes in the twentieth yeere of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in the ninth yeere of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in the second yeere of king <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, as by diuers other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes vpon great and grieuous penalties and forfeitures. Vpon signification of which resolution, his most excellent Maiestie, to the intent that none of his louing Subiects through any erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit or opinion might be deceiued and indamaged, hath in his Princely clemencie caused aswell the said resolution of his Iudges, as the Statutes themselues to bee particularized and published for the safety of his louing Subiects: And further doeth by these Presents straitly charge and command that all the said Lawes and Statutes concerning Transportation of Gold or Siluer be firmely holden, and kept and put in due execution. And doeth further prohibit and forbid all and all maner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoeuer, to cary or transport out of this Realme any Gold or Siluer in Coyne, Iewels, Bullion, Plate, or Vessel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any of the sayd Lawes or Statutes, as they wil answere the contrary at their vttermost perill.</p>

For wee are not ignorant, that of all other seditions and rebellions, none doeth bring such infinite waste and desolation vpon a Kingdome or State, as these popular Insurrections, which though they do seldome shake or indanger a Crowne, yet they doe bring a heape of calamities vpon multitudes of innocent Subiects, and chiefly vpon the Authors and Actors themselues.</p>
               <p>And againe, We do obserue, that there was not so much as any necessitie of famine or dearth of corne, or any other extraordinary accident, that might stirre or prouoke them in that maner to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; but that it may be thought to proceed of a kind of insolencie and contempt of our milde and gracious gouernment, which mought (in some Prince) turne the same into more heauy wrath and displeasure.

               <p>And therefore we doe hereby take and receiue all the sayd Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and euery of them, to our mercy, and of our grace and meere motion, freely pardon vnto them their sayd Offences, and all paines of death or other punishment due for the same, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto them, in the word of their naturall Liege Lord and King, that they shall not be in any wise molested or impeached, in life, member, lands or goods for their sayd Offences, or any of them.

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation concerning Starch.</head>
               <p>IT is not vnknowen to most of our louing Subiecs, That in the time of the late Queene of famous memory, the making of Starch within this Realme of England, being a thing newly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:177081:83"/> taken vp, and growen in few yeeres very frequent, and to bee much vsed, the inconuenience thereof was found to be so great, by the wasting and consuming of corne fit for peoples food, That many Proclamations were then made from time to time, for the repressing and vtter abolishing of the same. Howbeit, afterwards some particular persons, hauing procured a speciall License, as well for the making of Starch within the Realme, as also for bringing in the same from forreine parts, the libertie of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect was so preiudiced, by reducing of that into few mens power, which in the Common libertie of the Subiect was free to all, That much offence did arise thereby, Insomuch as the said grant, being afterwards by her, in fauour to the Subiects, taken away vpon the complaints of the grieuance arising thereby, and the making of that stuffe within this Realme being then left to the libertie of all men to vse it at their pleasure, the same hath euer sithence bene continued in many places of this Realme. In which small time of continuance, it falleth out by experience, that the toleration thereof to be made here, is accompanied with so much offence to our people, as we perceiue by the Information which thereof we haue receiued, That her intent and purpose to represse the making thereof, and to take away the inconuenience of the same, was not without good cause and iust ground. For it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by collection gathered, That the waste of corne spent and consumed in the making of this Stuffe in most places of this our Realme, is so excessiue, as it is not fit to bee spared from peoples Food, to serue in so vaine and slender an vse; For that it cannot be, but the spending thereof in Starch (especially in times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the plenty of Corne shall not be very abundant) must needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease both the scarcitie, and the prices thereof, aboue that which is fit to be suffered. And further it appeareth by the Complaints and Certificats, to vs and our Councell sent from diuers Iustices of the Peace of seuerall parts, (especially about our City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the Counties neere adioyning) That the making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not without exceeding annoyance to the people dwelling neere the places where it is made, by reason of the noisome stench and vnsauoury smells arising of and by the same: which breeding infectious aires, cannot but encrease most contagious sicknesses and diseases, especially in these times of common Infection: A danger fit to be preuented, in that prouidence which wee owe to the welfare of our people, as in euery part of the Realme general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so especially in our City of London, being our Chamber, the ordinary place of our abode for the best part of the yeere, and of the resort of all sorts of our Subiects for their necessary affaires.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:177081:83"/>
               <p>Which incommodities, hauing bene by vs, with the aduice of our Councel, throughly considered, We had a determination for the redresse thereof, and for the policie of our Realme, vtterly to take away the making of Starch within it, of what Stuffe, or vnder what pretence soeuer. Neuerthelesse, vpon the humble suit of a great number of our louing Subiects lately made vnto vs, it being apparant, that the vtter abolishing and taking away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would be a great hinderance to them in their trades, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue many of them of the meanes of their necessary liuing and maintenance; And being likewise enformed, that there may wel be spared, both in our City of <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> and other the great Cities and Townes of the Realme, great quantities of Branne, and other such courser Stuffes, of which the best and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Starch is vsually made; We, tendering the good and benefit of our said Subiects, and being well pleased, in our Princely care and desire of the Publike good, to yeeld vnto them the libertie and free vse of their needfull Trades, and of all due and conuenient meanes of their necessary maintenance, And yet holding it as fit and needfull to prouide for the redresse of all abuses and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, growing both by the needlesse wasting of the store of Corne within our Realme, and also by the publike annoyance and offence giuen vnto our Subiects, by the noysome making of Starch in most places of our Kingdome as aforesaid, Haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the aduice of our Councell, thought it good to giue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnto certaine persons of good qualitie and credite, by Commission vnder our great Seale of England, from time to time to view and suruey, &amp; allow al places and houses within any part of our Kingdome, where any Starch is or shalbe made, and with the assistance of the Maior, or chiefe Magistrate of that place which shall be next adioyning to any such place of Starch-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to see that none be from hencefoorth made of Wheat, but onely of cleane Branne, and such like courser stuffe; And that none shall hee made in any such place, as may bee to the iust an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance and offence of our louing Subiects, but onely in such places, and in such order, as by the discretion and appointment of our sayd Commissioners, and such Magistrates next adioyning, shalbe thought fit.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for Iurors.</head>
               <p>AS it is a principall part of our Kingly Office, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iustice to our people, by which our Crowne and scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is also established and confirmed: So we conceiue, that we may truely and iustly thus farre reape the fruit of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as to be witnesse to our selfe, and likewise to report our selues, not onely to our Priuie Counsell, (which are acquainted
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177081:85"/> with our more secret cares and cogitations) and our Iudges and Counsell at Law (with whom we haue had more frequent confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then Princes formerly haue vsed) but generally also to all other our louing subiects, in regard of some our publike actions, Whether in these few yeeres of our Reigne (notwithstanding we could not be at our first entrance so well enformed, as now we are, in the Lawes and Customes of this our Realme) we haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and employed our Princely care, power and meanes, for the furtherance and aduancement of Iustice duely and speedily to be administred to all our louing Subiects. For it appeareth, that we haue to that end bene at charge to encrease the number of our Iudges in our principall Benches, haue endeuoured to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate some differences and contentions amongst our Courts in point of Iurisdiction, to auoyd double vexation of Suits, and haue from time to time, in person giuen more strait charge and admonition to our Iudges before the Circuits and visitations, and receiued againe from them more strait accompts and reports at their returnes, then hath bene heretofore accustomed. And as we haue bene thus carefull concerning our Courts, and Iudges of the Law: So may wee in no wise omit to extend our Princely care to persons of another condition, on whom (though they bee not to bee termed Iudges) there lieth a principall part of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature: which are those, who by the Custome of the Realme are called Iurors, which serue to trie and decide the Issues &amp; points of fact in all controuersies and causes. A matter no lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the summe of Iustice, then the true and iudicious exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lawes themselues. For euen that Iudgement which was giuen by a King in Person, and is so much commended in the Scriptures, was not any learned exposition of the Lawe, but a wise sifting and examination of the fact, where testimony was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and failed. To which sort of persons also the Law of this our Realme doeth ascribe such trust and confidence, as it doth not so absolutely tie them to the euidences and proofes produced, but that it leaueth both supply of testimonie, and the discerning and credit of testimonie to the Iuries consciences and vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>But herewithall we consider with our selues, That this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by Iurie (which is one of the ancient lawes and customs of this our Iland of Great Britaine, and almost proper and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vnto it, in regard of other Nations) as it is an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in it selfe, so neuerthelesse it is then laudable and good, when those persons, which serue vpon the sayd Iuries, are men of such qualitie, credit and vnderstanding, as are worthy to bee trusted with so great a charge, as to trie mens liues, good names,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:177081:85"/> lands and goods, and whatsoeuer they hold deare in this world. Wherein we cannot but obserue, and highly commend the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Lawes of this our Realme (taking them in their owne nature, before abuses crep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> in) which haue in this poynt so well prouided. For as in the triall of any Peere of this Realme, the Law doeth not admit any to passe vpon him but Peeres: So in the triall of any of the Commons (which the Lawe beholdeth but as one body) there is no person whatsoeuer of that body by rule of Law exempted, in respect of his qualitie and degree onely, from the seruice vpon Iuries: whereas on the contrary part the Law hath limitted, that none serue, except hee haue a certaine proportion of Freehold. And yet notwithstanding, time and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse haue so embased the estimation of this seruice, and altered the vse thereof, as Sheriffes, Vndersheriffes, Bailiffes, and other inferiour Ministers, do not onely spare Gentlemen of quality, in a kinde of awe, and vnwillingnesse to offend them, but doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for lucre, gaine and reward, forbeare to returne many of the ablest and fittest persons; So that the Seruice oftentimes resteth vpon such as are either simple and ignorant, and almost at a gaze in any cause of difficultie, or else vpon those that are so accustomed and indured to passe and serue vpon Iuries, as they haue almost lost that tendernesse of Conscience, which in such cases is to be wished, and make the seruice, as it were an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practise.</p>
               <p>Vpon these grounds therefore, and vpon aduise taken with our Priuie Councell, and conference with our Iudges and Councell at Law, We haue resolued to giue some remedy to those abuses, and to restore the forme of trials in this our Realme of England, to the ancient integrity and credit, as much as in vs lyeth. And therefore we doe hereby publish and declare to all our louing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that they take light from vs of the greatnesse of this seruice, and that the Gentlemen of best qualitie doe put away that vaine and vntrue conceit, that they are any wayes disgraced, or disestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if they be called vpon or vsed in this part of Iustice, to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the fact, Knowing that all Iudgement is Gods principally, and by him committed vnto vs within the Precinct of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as his minister vpon earth, to whom likewise they are subordinate. And wee doe likewise charge and command all our Iudges, Iustices, sheriffes, Vndersheriffes, Bayliffes and others to whom it may appertaine, To take knowledge that this is our expresse wil and pleasure, That all persons which haue Freehold, according to the Law, shalbe returned to serue vpon Iuries, as occasion shall require. Foreseeing also that they vse a respect, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:177081:86"/> the same persons be not too often returned and troubled, but that the seruice may rest more equally &amp; indifferently vpon the whole body of sufficient Freeholders i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now that we haue thus declared our earnest care and zeale for the furtherance of Iustice in this kind, seeing it hath bin vsual for sheriffes and other ministers (to whom it appertaines) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the returning of diuers persons, in respect that they were sonnes to PÃ©eres of our Realme, or men of extraordinary place and calling, which we haue no way misliked, &amp; do wel allow: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending likewise that such, &amp; so conuenient respect be vsed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to our Iustices of Peace, in regard of the place they hold, and their cÅtinual imploiments, as they may be no oftner vsed in seruices of that nature, then shal be necessary: And forasmuch as we do wel consider that it may so fall out many times, that diuers persons besides those aboue named, and such other as the Lawe for naturall impotency dispenseth withall in an ordinary course, may like wise be found meet to be forborne in these seruices: we do hereby declare, that we are also resolued by vertue of our preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue (and according to the ancient presidents of our progenitors) to grant special exemption by our letters Patents to some such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and vpÅ such special causes as we shall thinke iust and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, not meaning from henceforth to leaue it in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, but in the special cases aforesaid, to do that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to our selfe. In which course (as in al the rest of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings) although it appeareth vnto vs by a Certificate lately made frÅ the sheriffes, of the state of the Freeholders in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the multitude of them is great &amp; are otherwise as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enformed, that the one halfe is not certified: and although we haue bene &amp; are daily importuned for some particular exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅs by diuers persons, aswel knights &amp; gentlemen, as other free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of good ability: neuerthelesse, because it may appeare that we do and euer will preserre the precious care of Iustice before an other second considerations, we resolue there shalbe so good a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the number, aswell as in the choice of the persons, as no preiudice shal arise therby in the ordinary course of Iustice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our meaning be, that all such Grants so to be made by vs, shal extend aswel to al causes concerning our selfe, our heires and successors, as our subiects.

For although there be manifest cause of greater concourse of people to the said Citie, and by consequence, of habitation and receit for them, by reason of the largenesse of his Highnesse dominions, &amp; the vniuersall peace wherein his Maiestie liues and gouernes: yet notwithstanding his Maiesty (considering that the foundations already laid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the saide City and Suburbs and Confines of the same cannot but be sufficient for all that shall haue iust cause to dwell or abide hereabouts) hath therfore resolued, that vnlesse it bee in some rare cases, and by special Licence, as hereafter in these Presents shalbe prescribed, there shall bee no more new buildings erected in or neere the sayde City of London: and also that those that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:177081:87"/> shall bee erected vpon olde foundations, shall bee such as shall both adorne and beautifie his sayde Citie, and bee lesse subiect to danger of fire, and cause lesse waste of Timber (fitter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for the shipping of his Realme) and likewise such as in regard of the charge of building, can not bee inhabited but by persons of some ability. And because the former Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kinde heretofore published are seuerall, and in some points defectiue: therefore his Maiesty hath thought good (not intending thereby to dispense with former offenders) to make and publish one cleare Proclamation digested into plaine and distinct Articles, that the offenders hereafter may be without all colour of excuse, as they are already without all iust defence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maiesty doeth straitly charge and command all maner of persons, of what quality soeuer they bee, duely to obserue and fulfill, and all Officers and persons in Authority whom it may concerne, duely, carefully, and diligently to see obserued, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and put in execution these Articles folowing.</p>
               <p>FIrst, That no manner of buildings, bee they dwelling Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Stables, Shops, Stalles, or any other building whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, be from hencefoorth erected, or attempted to be erected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City of London, or the Suburbs thereof, or within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of two miles, to be taken from any of the gates of the sayd city (except it be vpon the foundation of a former dwelling house, or in or vpon some inner Court or Yard of the same house:) And if any building contrary to this Article of his Maiesties prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall happen to be begun, that the same bee foorth with by the Iustices of Peace within that limit, or Alderman of the Ward, or any of them, stayed from any further proceeding. And aswell such Builder, as the workemen vpon such building to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison, and bound ouer to answere their contempt in the Starre Chamber, and the Timber or other stuffe imployed or to be imployed thereupon, to be sold by the sayd Iustices, or Aldermen, or any of them, to the reliefe of the poore of the Parish where the sayd building shall happen to bee. And in case through neglect, or ouersight, any such building happen to be finished, or in part done before stay made thereof: that neuerthelesse the same may be &amp; shall be by the said Iustices or Aldermen, or any of them at any time within seuen yeres after the finishing of the said buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, pulled downe, and the offenders punished, and the stuffe and matter of the saide building bestowed as is before expressed.</p>

               <p>ANd if any house shall be let contrary to this Article, as well the taker as the Leassor to be deemed an offender, and to be committed to prison, and bound ouer to answere the same in the Starrechamber.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:177081:88"/> against this Article, shall be Fined, and Imprisoned for the same by Order of the Court of Starrechamber.</p>
               <p>ALl new Buildings that for the time already passed haue bene built since the first day of March in the second yeere of his Maiesties Reigne, and haue not their forefronts and walles of Bricke as aforesayd, contrarie to his Maiesties Proclamation in that behalfe at that time published, shall bee certified by the Iustices or Aldermen vnto his Maiesties learned Councell, that there may bee a present proceeding against the offenders in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>ANd forasmuch as the Diuiding of Houses into seuerall Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements and Habitations, and the letting of part of Houses and Chambers to Inmates and Vndersitters, is no lesse incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient then excessiue Building as well in regard of surcharge of people, specially of the worse sort, as for breeding and spreading of Infection, besides other inconueniences proper to this abuse, His Maiestie doeth further charge and straightly command, that these Articles following bee also duely obserued and obeyed.</p>

And such Iustices or Aldermen which shall be found negligent or remisse in the execution of these Articles, his Maiestie will haue censured and punished as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of his Royall commandement, and to be remoued from being Iustice of Peace, as vnworthy so to be.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation touching the Earles of Tyrone and Tyrconnell.</head>
               <p>SEeing it is common and natural in all persons of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition soeuer, to speake and iudge variably of all new and sudden accidents, And that the flight of the Earles of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnell,</hi> with some others of their fellowes out of the North parts of our Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> may haply proue a subiect of like discourse: Wee haue thought it not amisse to deliuer some such matter in publique, as may better cleare mens iudgements concerning the same; not in respect of any worth or value in these mens persons, being base and rude in their Originall; but to take away all such inconueniences as may blemish the reputation of that friendship which ought to be mutually obserued betweene vs and other Princes. For although it is not vnlikely, that the report of their Titles and dignities, may draw from Princes and States some such courtesies at their first comming abroad, as are incident to men of extraordinary rancke and qualitie: Yet when we haue taken the best meanes we can to lay them open in euery condition, we shal then expect from our friends and neighbors all such iust and noble proceedings, as stand with the rules of honour and friendship, and from our Subiects at home and abroad, that duety and obedience (in their carriage toward them) which they owe to vs by inseparable bonds and obligations of Nature and Loyalty, whereof we intend to take strait accompt. For which purpose we doe hereby first declare that these persons aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had not their creations or possessions in regard of any line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or lawfull descent from ancestors of blood or vertue, but were onely preferred by the late Queene our sister of famous memory, and by our selues for some reasons of State before others, who for their qualitie and birth (in those prouinces where they dwel) might better haue challenged those honours which were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon them. Secondly we do professe, That it is both knowen to vs and our Counsel here, and to our Deputie and State there, and so shall it appeare to the world (as cleare as the Sunne) by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:177081:89"/> euident proofes, That the onely ground and motiue of this high contempt in these mens departure, hath bene the priuate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and inward terrour of their owne guiltinesse: Whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we heare that they doe seeke to take away the blot and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by diuulging that they haue withdrawen themselues for matter of Religion, (a cloake that serues too much in these dayes to couer many euil intentions) adding also thereunto some other vaine pretexts of receiuing iniustice, when their rights &amp; claimes haue come in question betweene them and vs, or any of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and them, we thinke it not impertinent to say somewhat thereof.</p>
               <p>And therefore, although we iudge it needlesse to seeke for many arguments to confirme whatsoeuer shall bee sayd of these mens corruption and falshood, (whose hainous offences remaine so fresh in memory since they declared themselues so very monsters in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they did not onely withdraw themselues from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall obedience to their Soueraigne, but were content to sell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their natiue Countrey to those that stood at that time in the highest termes of hostilitie with the two Crownes of England and Ireland) yet to make the absurditie and ingratitude of the allegations aboue mentioned, so much the more cleare to all men of equall iudgment, We doe hereby professe in the word of a King, that there was neuer so much as any shadow of molestation, nor purpose of proceeding in any degree against them for matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: Such being their condition and profession, to thinke murder no fault, mariage of no vse, nor any man worthy to be esteemed valiant that did not glory in rapine and oppression, as we should haue thought it an vnreasonable thing to trouble them for any different point in religion, before any man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by their conuersation, that they made truely conscience of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religion. So we doe also for the second part of their excuse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, (that notwithstanding all that they can claime, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to proceed from meere grace vpon their submission after their great and vnnaturall treasons) there hath neuer come any question concerning their rights or possessions, wherein wee haue not bene more inclinable to doe them fauour, then to any of their Competitours, except in those cases wherein we haue plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discerned that their onely end was to haue made themselues by degrees more able then now they are, to resist all lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie (when they should returne to their vomit againe) by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping a power ouer other good Subiects of ours, that dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them better borne then they, and vtterly disclaiming from any dependancie vpon them.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:177081:90"/>
               <p>Hauing now deliuered thus much concerning these mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and their proceedings, We will onely end with this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, That they shall not be able to deny, whensoeuer they should dare to present themselues before the Seat of iustice, that they haue (before their running out of our Kingdome) not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into combination for stirring sedition and intestine rebellion, but haue directed diuers instruments, as well Priests as others, to make offers to forreine States and Princes (if they had beene as ready to receiue them) of their readinesse and resolution to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them, whensoeuer they would seeke to inuade that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherein amongst other things, this is not to be forgotten, That vnder the condition of being made free from English go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, they resolued also to comprehend the vtter extirpation of all those Subiects that are now remaining aliue within that Kingdome, formerly descended from the English race. In which practises and propositions, folowed and fomented by Priests and Iesuits (of whose function in these times the practise and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of subiects to rebell against their Soueraignes, is one special and essential part and portion) as they haue found no such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement as they expected and haue boasted of: so Wee doe assure our selues, that when this declaration shall bee seene and duely weighed with all due circumstances, it will be of force sufficient to disperse and to discredit all such vntrueths, as these contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures so full of infidelitie and ingratitude, shall disgorge against vs, and our iust and moderate proceeding, and shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto them no better vsage then they would wish should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to any such packe of Rebels, borne their Subiects, and bound vnto them in so many and so great obligations.</p>

That these Orders fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, be obserued and put in execution.</p>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> 100. pound the principall, and the Sureties 30. pound a peece to his Maiesties vse, not to dresse any flesh in their houses this Lent time for any respect, nor suffer it to be eaten, except it bee for some such person that lieth in their house, that also hath licence through sickenesse, or other necessary cause to eate flesh. Also like bonds shall bee taken of the Poulters, not to vtter any Poultry ware, but to such as shall be likewise licensed to eat flesh, and that such as will not giue such bonds, that they be secluded from all vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of victuals during the Lent season, excepting those Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that do ordinarily serue his Maiesties houshold, of whom like bonds shalbe taken by his Maiesties officers of the <hi>Greencloth:</hi> the like bonds with sureties shalbe taken of the like persons vpon like penalties by the chiefe officers of <hi>Westminster,</hi> &amp; the liberties therof.</p>
               <p>And for the Butchers and other that come with victuals of flesh out of the Countrie to the Citie, the Lord Maior shall cause cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons to watch at the Gates and other like places in the Suburbs where flesh may be brought in, to view and search, and to intercept the same. The Carriers of the sayd victuals of flesh if any shall be taken, to be guided to the persons houses that haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, &amp; this watch to be continued dayly during the whole time of Lent: And if any of those watchmen be found negligent &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in his charge, then he to be committed to prison, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue during the whole Lent. And in case the same shall be found to be brought to any person not warranted, or licensed to eat it as is aforesayd, then the same to be forfeited and sold at the direction of the Lord Maior for the vse of the poore in the Hospitals and Prisons in the Citie, and the bringers to be imprisoned.</p>
               <p>And for that it is to be doubted that the Fishmongers, vpon the obseruation of the said orders, will take occasion therby to inhanse the prices as well of fresh as of Sea fish, it is thought meete that the Lord Maior shall take order with the sayd Fishmongers, that as well the salt as fresh fish shall be vttered at reasonable prices.</p>
               <p>That euery of the butchers to be licensed as aforesayd, be bound in a sufficient bond with good Sureties to his Maiesties vse, to obserue these orders in euery respect, and these bonds to be taken by the Lord Maior, and other the Officers aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And as those orders are expresly deuised to be executed in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of London, and places neere to the same: so his Maiesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and commandement is, that the execution of these or like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be performed by the commandement of his Maiesties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants to be sent to the Iustices of peace in all Shires within their rule, &amp; to all other officers in townes corporate, or in any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, with like order for bonds to be taken to his Maiesties vse.</p>

For which purpose, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we doe dayly see by common experience, that excessiue prices grow vpon our Subiects by the practise and greedinesse of priuate persons, who either by Forestalling and ingrossing of commodities, or by combyning to keepe them at high prices, or by conueying them out of our Realme by stealth, doe increase the rates aswell of foraine, as home bred commodities, without any Act of ours: Neuerthelesse, because we haue obserued that some euil affected people, in this, as in diuers other things, are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to impute the cause of grieuance to some thing done by vs, then to resort to the maine and original grounds of the same; We haue for more surety, caused our Councell to take information what Licences we haue giuen, (which haply may haue bene some pretext for abuse in that kinde) and thereby finding that some small quantitie of that commoditie hath bene Transported by vertue of a License granted at our first comming, at the Suite of some forraine Princes our Allies, whom we could hardly then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, although it be knowen to the world, that we did not giue Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

For considering that wee had neuer any intention in the forme of that Oath to presse any poynt of Conscience for matter of Religion, but onely to make some discouery of disloyall affection: the refusall thereof in any person must both induce a vehement suspitiÅ in it selfe, and much more in such a one as may bee probably supposed to haue come from such parts, where he may haue conuersed with Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Fugitiues, and is also of a needie fortune, which may make him apt for any dangerous or desperate imployment: And therefore we haue resolued, and accordingly doe charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all persons authorized by Law, to minister the sayd Oath, that taking information from the Officers of our Ports, and by all other good wayes and meanes, they faile not to tender the same Oath at the Ports to all our Subiects comming from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, (not being knowen merchants or men of some qualitie) and vpon refusall thereof the Law to be seuerely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which willeth to commit them to prison vntill the next Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or generall quarter Sessions, and so vpon a second refusall to be brought within the degree of a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> Wherein, because the penaltie is so grieuous (of which neuerthelesse we can not in our Princely prouidence make any alteration) We haue thought good to notifie our resolution, and order giuen therein, which we doubt not, but will be in small time dispersed abroad; to the end that such as now are, or hereafter shall bee in forraine parts,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:177081:94"/> and finde in their owne hearts such affections, as can not stand with the sayd Oath, may know their perill, and thereby either refraine their comming in, or expect the execution of our Lawes.</p>

               <p>THe Kings Maiestie hauing taken knowledge of the high prices of Graine and other victuals, lately and very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly growen in sundry parts of this Realme, And finding no sufficient reason thereof, doth iudge that the rich Owners of Corne doe keepe their store from common markets, thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the prices therof, Or els that the same is engrossed vnduely into few hands, and so the multitude of poore people hauing no Graine of their owne growing, must needs sustaine great lacke. His Highnesse therefore for remedie thereof, hath caused speciall Orders to be made and published through all parts of this realme, bearing date the first day of Iune 1608, and Intituled, <hi>Orders ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by his Maiestie, &amp;c.</hi> By which the Iustices of Peace in all parts of the Realme, are directed to stay all Engrossers, Forestal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Regraters of Corne, and to direct all Owners and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, (hauing Corne to spare) to furnish the markets rateably and weekely, with such quantities as reasonably they may and ought to doe, and to see diuers other Articles obserued and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, tending to the preuention and remedy of this inconuenience. Neuerthelesse, because his Maiestie doth well know, that the life of these his gracious, godly, and politique Constitutions, depends vpon the carefull and diligent execution of the same: His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth therefore by this his Proclamation (to the end that no person whome it may concerne, shall or may pleade ignorance) straitly charge and command all Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Bayliffes, Constables, and other his Officers and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects whatsoeuer, That they take knowledge of the sayd Orders, and obserue and cause the same to be obserued, as shall appertaine vnto them, as they tender his displeasure.</p>
               <p>And because there may be iust cause to feare, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the strait prouisions that are lately taken against trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Graine, yet vnder colour of conueying of it from port
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:177081:94"/> to port within the lande, some may bee conueyed into forraine parts: Therefore for further prouision in that behalfe, besides the bonds in that case appoynted to be taken, His Maiestie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and giueth licence to any person that shall haue cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that any such corne is or should be shipped, or prouided to bee shipped by lawfull authoritie to be caried to any other Port, that the same may be by fraud caried out of the Realme; such person hauing such cause to suspect, shall giue information thereof to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iustice of peace, or publike officer dwelling neere to the Port, Which Iustice or Officer shall with the sayd Informer, repaire to the Custome house of any such Port or Creeke where Corne is shipped, or prouided to be shipped, and there shall duely examine both the Officers of the Custome house, and the sellers, buyers, and shippers of the corne vpon their seuerall oathes, whether they know of any intention directly, or indirectly, to haue the sayd Corne to be caried out of the Realme. And further also, when by their Oathes they shall cleare themselues of any such intention (thereby the suspition conceiued being cleared) yet the Officers of the Ports that haue authority to take bonds, shall shew the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who vpon pregnant suspition shall require the same, and giue them in writing the contents of the bond, with the names of the parties bound, being sufficient to answere the same, the true quantitie of the graine, and the ports to which it is intended to haue the same caried: And if notwithstanding such prouision of good assurance taken, there shall afterwards any doubt followe, that notwithstanding the sayd bonds the sayd corne shall be caried out of the realme, The partie that shal haue cause so to suspect the same, shall repaire to some Iustice of peace, whome his Maiestie doeth hereby command to examine the trueth at the Port where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the said Corne was appoynted. And for that purpose the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of that port shall make plaine declaration whether any such corne, or what quantity therof came to that port within the time limitted; And if by good proofe it shall any wayes appeare, that there hath beene any fraud in any officer of the Port, or falshood in the Transporter by carying it out of the Realme, the Officer of the Port shall bee depriued of his Office, and suffer imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make Fine to his Maiestie at his pleasure; And the Transporter for carying it out of the Realme, and the seller and buyer, or either of them being priuie thereto, shall be committed to prison for the space of one yeere, and the ship forfeited; And the Informer for his labour and reward, shall haue both the halfe of the value of the corne transported, and the halfe of the Fines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon the offenders. And for the triall of these offences, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:177081:95"/> execution of the punishments and Fines, the same shall bee tryed in his Maiesties exchequer, as all Informations are vpon penall Statutes, where all expedition shall be vsed, or before the Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Assise in their Circuits, or before any Iustices of Peace in the Sessions where the offence shall bee committed, hauing any authoritie to heare and determine any penall Law.</p>
               <p>Finally, his Maiestie is particularly informed of some inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sundry persons of abilitie to keepe Hospitalitie in their Countreys, to leaue their Hospitalities, and to come to the Citie of London, and other Cities and Townes corporate, thereby lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the reliefe of their poore neighbours, as well for food, as for good rule, and with couetous mindes to liue in London, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie priuately, and so also in other Townes corporate, without charge of company.

Of the performance and execution of which his Maiesties orders, It is his Highnes pleasure that the Iustices doe make certificate vpon all occasions to his Maiesties Priuie Councell, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for his Highnesse better satisfaction, what price Corne and victuals doe beare.</p>

               <p>ALbeit our great care to prouide for the good and welfare of our louing Subiects, hath at all times appeared in the whole course of our Proceedings since our comming into this Kingdome, aswel for preuenting, as for remouing all abuses and inconueniences; And knowing, that there is not any one thing, that can be more bitter and grieuous vnto all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (especially those of the poorer sort) then the feare or feeling of scarcitie and dearth of Corne, and other Victuals, Wee haue not onely in regard thereof, giuen former commandement by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and other Orders lately published, to prouide against the great scarcitie and dearth of corne, but also for the more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:177081:95"/> in a matter of so great consequence to our people, vpon diuers Certificats and complaints to vs and our Counsel sent from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry the Iustices of Peace of seuerall parts of this Realme, We did both giue strict direction for restrayning the excessiue making of Starch, because we conceiued it might be a meanes to waste the Corne and Graine of this our Realme, and vpon the humble suit of the better sort of the Starch makers themselues, did authorize certaine selected persons, by Commission vnder the Great Seale of England, with the assistance of the Magistrates in all places of this Kingdome, to see and take order, that no Starch should bee made of Wheat, or of any other stuffe fit for the food &amp; sustenance of man, but onely of cleane Branne, or such like courser stuffe. Since which time, hauing bene enfourmed, that our great care and earnest desire in that behalfe, hath not sorted to that good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which was then purposed, by reason that many bad and ill disposed persons, which neuer before had vsed the making of Starch, haue since that time, out of a greedy desire, and for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse of gaine, newly set vp, and erected Starch-making in sundry places of this land, without any allowance from our said Commissioners, and the Magistrates authorized thereunto, And that many others also, who formerly vsed Starch-making, haue since continued to make it of Wheat, and other stuffe, which might haue serued in times of dearth, for the reliefe of the poorer sort of our people, Whereby we doe perceiue and foresee, that by the vse of Starch-making, both the scarcitie and dearth of Corne, may be also continued or increased, if it should not speedily be preuented: Although wee haue vouchsafed of late to release the payment of Custome to all persons which would bring in any forreine Corne, thereby the better to supply the present want at home; And albeit we shall by this course which followeth, lose great part of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which ariseth vnto vs from the voluntary contributions of the Starch-makers: Neuerthelesse, in our Princely care, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the Publique good, and to the intent that all occasions may be remoued and taken away, which shall or may in any sort be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to our Subiects, whose welfare we preferre before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or aduantage to our selfe, by expending or employing either any Corne, Graine, or other stuffe in the making of Starch, that may be of vse to them within this Realme, especially in this time, wherein so great a shew of scarcity and want appeareth, as by the expence of so great quantities of sundry sorts of Graine dayly brought from forreine parts into seuerall Ports of this our Realme appeareth, but principally into our Port of <hi>London:</hi> From whence, forsomuch as we are certified, that amongst sundry
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177081:96"/> great quantities of Corne and graine that now are daily brought thither from forreine parts, good sweet; and merchantable, to the great reliefe of our Subiects, there are also some parcels of corne brought, which by foule weather and contrary winds happening to take wet, and to be long deteined at Sea, one thereby become so much decayed, mustie, and vnsauory, as the lame is altogether vnholsome for the food and sustenance of man, and not fit for any other vse, then onely to be conuerted and made into Starch, and that for the good of such Merchants, whom such misfortune shall so befall.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we hauing with the aduice of our Councell concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that it is very requisite for the time to prohibit and suppresse the making of Starch in all places of this our Realme and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion aforesaid, and to giue order that no person or persons whatsoeuer shal hereafter make, or cause to be made, any Starch of any Corne, Graine, or other stuffe whatsoeuer in any place or places within our said Realme of England and Dominion of Wales, except onely in such maner, and of such stuffe as is herein prouided, and hereafter expressed, and to that end haue thought fit to signifie our pleasure to all louing Subiects by our Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Willing and straitly charging and commanding all, and all maner of persons whatsoeuer which now doe, or heretofore haue vsed the making of Starch within any place or places of our Kingdome of England and dominion of Wales whatsoeuer, and which haue or shall haue an intent or purpose to make starch, from henceforth to surcease and forbeare to make any Starch at all, either of Wheat, Pollard, Branne, or any other stuffe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, and also that they do not presume at any time or times here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to steepe or cause to be steeped or put in water, or to prepare or prouide any Wheat, Pollard, Branne, or other stuffe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, with intent and purpose to make the same into Starch, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be onely of such decayed and musty Wheat, bare Branne, or such other stuffe, not fit for mans sustenance as aforesaid, and that onely by such persons as shalbe thereunto appointed, nominated and allowed by some of our Priuy Councell, or by such other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet persons as they shall thinke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And if any person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoeuer shall attempt or presume after the last day of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instant, to offend or do contrary to our expresse wil and pleasure hereby signified: Wee doe by these Presents let them know and vnderstand that our will and pleasure is, that he or they so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, shall not onely loose and forfeit all the Starch so made or to be made, of which the one halfe shalbe to the party seising the same, and the other halfe to vs, our heires and successors: But our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning also is with all seuerity to proceed against all such offendors, and for their contempt of our prerogatiue Royall in a matter ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so much to the good and benefit of our people, to inflict such further punishment as is vsuall in cases of such contempt.

               <p>THe continuall new Buildings, and addition and increase of buildings in &amp; neere about the City of <hi>London</hi> is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to that excesse, and doeth draw together such an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow of people, specially of the meaner sort, as can hardly be either fed and susteined, or preserued in health or gouerned, which doth not onely threaten, but hath already bred and brought foorth at diuers times dearth of victuals, infection of plague, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold disorders, which his Maiestie in his Royall wisedome before this time foreseeing, hath since his happy comming to the Crowne, by two seuerall Proclamations, The one in the second yeere of his Highnesse Reigne concerning building with Bricke, the other in the fift yeere of his Reigne concerning building vpon new foundations, (wherein neuerthelesse the former ordinance touching Bricke buildings is continued) sought to giue remedie and prouision for the same; But such hath beene and is the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desire of gaine and priuate benefit arising of such buildings, ioyned with a neglect of Iustices and Officers in executing his Maiesties sayd Proclamations, as many persons haue presumed and aduentured to offend against them, both to the continuance and increase of the former euils and inconueniences, and to the manifest ill example of contempt and disobedience in a case so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and in the view of the whole Kingdome: His Maiestie neuerthelesse not forgetting (though vpon so iust cause of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) his accustomed clemencie, hath thought good to make a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:177081:97"/> difference betweene the offenders and their cases, and for such as haue offended in not building with Bricke, in as much as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were in great multitude, and might haue some colour of necessity, or pretended impossibilitie, though vniustly, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues must needs confesse, if they looke abroad, and see what is done in other well polliced Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> His Highnesse gaue order that after some exemplar censure of a few offenders by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> the residue should be admitted to compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition according to his Maiesties Commission of grace for that purpose granted, wherein his Maiesties expresse pleasure was, That the Fines should bee so milde and moderate as might make the Offenders themselues sensible of his Maiesties lenitie and gracious disposition, and might make all others perceiue, That it was not his Maiesties profit that was sought, but onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of the inconuenience, and the preseruing of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Maiesties Royall commandements for the publique good, from contempt. But for the second sort of offenders, which haue erected new foundations where no buildings were before, which had no maner of circumstance to extenuate their offence, but many to aggrauate the same, being against a Proclamation so lately published, and so straitly penned, and immediatly after a seuere sentence in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> his Maiesty hath directed that all such Offenders, (the number of which cannot be many being within the compasse of one yere) shalbe proceeded with in the <hi>Star-chamber.</hi> But as his Maiestie doth not thinke fit to admit at all to grace that kind of Offenders, so his Highnesse doth publish and declare, That for the other point of Bricke building, no man doe hereafter expect any the like fauour of Composition, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie was pleased onely at this time for the auoyding of rigor and extremitie to grant and extend: But his Maiesties will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, That his sayd ordinance bee hereafter straitly obserued, and maintained, and the offenders against the same with all seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie punished. And to the end to remoue and take away all colour of pretended necessity in that point, His Maiestie is graciously pleased that his former proclamations be explained and qualified in maner and forme following, That is to say, That if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that shall hereafter erect any building vpon an old foundation within the precincts limitted in the proclamation published in the fift yeere of his Highnesse raigne, shall make it appeare, That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the quantitie of the ground whereupon the olde foundation standeth, is of too small a proportion to receiue a Bricke building, or that the house is situate in so obscure or meane a Lane or Alley, as is not fit for such a building, or that the trade of such person as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177081:98"/> intendeth such building, is the trade of a retailing shopkeeper, and of such a nature as his shop and building cannot with any conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience be built with Bricke, and thereupon shall obtaine certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnder the hands of the L. Maior, the Recorder, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of the Ward, if the building be within the Citie or the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties thereof, and vnder the hands of two Iustices of the peace, whereof one to be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> if it be out of the Citie and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, And shall further vpon the sayd Certificate, procure a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence vnder the hands of any foure of his Maiesties priuy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereof, the Lord Chancellour, L. Treasourer, L. Priuie Seale, and Chancellour of the Exchequer for the time being, to be two in allowance of the same, That in such case such person so building, shall not be deemed and taken for an offendour against his Maiesties proclamations, any thing in the sayd Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or either of them to the contrary hereof in any wise notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation concerning Fines for Alienations of Lands holden in Chiefe, made without Record.</head>
               <p>WHereas it is acknowledged by all men (as it must needs be) that Fines for Alienations of lands holden in Chiefe, are of right due vnto vs &amp; our Crowne, as one of the most ancient, iust, and Royal reuenues belonging to the same; And yet it is as well knowne, that Lands of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue beene, and are often aliened by Feoffements, Grants of Reuersions, Wills, Exchanges, Couenants, and other like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyances made without Record, for which no Fines are answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, onely because the Conueyances are not of Record, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot come (without great charge) to the knowledge of our Officers, to whose care the same doeth appertaine, but are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and against conscience by the Purchasers hidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, whereas Fines are as well due in that case, as if the same
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:177081:99"/> Conueyances were of Record, and are accordingly required and payed without exception, wheresoeuer they are discouered: In which respect, there was about a yeere past, in diuers Counties a course taken, as well to finde out such Alienations without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by Commissions of enquiry, and other lawfull meanes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to require and take such Fines as should be found due according to the Law, of all those that should appeare to bee liable to the same Fines.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as we haue euer bene enclined to vse grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, rather then seuerity, euen in those things which all men know to be most clearly due to vs, as in this case amongst others, wherein no man can challenge any exemption in course of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice from payment of a full yeeres value of the Lands so Aliened, especially being such as haue so ill deserued any fauour at our hands, from whom they haue so long withheld our due, &amp; meant still to doe, vnlesse they should be by some extraordinary care and charge laied open and discouered, we haue bene pleased (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their former courses, so farre to the preiudice of vs in our iust dueties and demands) both to make stay of execution of all and euery of those Commissions, and other enquiries formerly sent out, whereof the charge and disquiet would fall heauily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Subiects: and haue also resolued by this our gracious Proclamation to make knowen to all those who know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues answerable for any such Fines, that we will be content out of our princely fauour to forbeare those meanes which will easily discouer trueth, &amp; remit vnto them the greater part of our Fines, according to the Articles hereunto annexed. Prouided alwayes, that they shall willingly and duetifully pay the rest of that which we shall not forgiue, for our owne proper vse into the Office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienations, where our ministers wil bee ready to giue them a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vpon receit thereof.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 And for Alienations of Estates for liues past, the Fines shall be the fourth part onely of the yeeres value, if they yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues voluntarily within the time aforesayde, Or otherwise to pay the whole yeeres value, As in the case of Estates of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Law making no difference in these cases.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Vpon Alienations of Estates of inheritance that shall bee made hereafter without Record, there shall bee payed but two parts of the three, of so much as shall be due by Law, in such cases both vpon pardons and licences, if the parties themselues within foure moneths after such Alienations made, shal first discouer the same, and offer Composition at our office of Alienations.</p>

               <p>VVHereas the Kings Maiestie, for the better reliefe and sustentation of the poorer sort of people within this his Kingdome, in this time of scarcity &amp; dearth of Corne and Graine, did out of his Princely and gracious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, lately cause certaine Orders to be generally published and sent into all the Counties, Cities, and principall places of this Realme, for the seruing of the Markets from time to time with conuenient quantities of Corne and Graine, whereby the poore might be chiefly prouided for with so much thereof, as should bee necessary for them at reasonable rates: And whereas it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to giue this yeere greater increase of Barley then of other Graines, which of it selfe, or being mingled with Wheat or Rye, wil make good Bread, especially for the poorer sort of people: His Maiestie is giuen to vnderstand, that of this great quantitie of Barley (whereof the greatest part ought and might be made into Bread as aforesaid) much is by the infinite multitude of Mault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, like to be turned into Mault as hitherto it hath bene, and then againe by Common-brewers brued into strong Beere and Ale, which consumes double the Mault that is needfull, and serues not for vse, but for drunkennes and excesse; Although both by the Lawes now in force, and by the said Orders lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, there is prouision against these abuses. His Maiestie therefore continuing his Princely care for the preseruation and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:177081:100"/> reliefe of his poore Subiects, And to the ende that the great waste and consumption of Barley in making of mault may bee preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the poore may haue sufficient store of Barley to make bread for their sustenance at reasonable prices, in this time of scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Wheat and Rye, Hath therefore thought good, and by this his Proclamation doeth straitly charge and command all Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace, Maiors, Constables, Headboroughes, and other his Officers to whom it appertaineth, That they forth with after the publishing of this his Proclamation, doe carefully and diligently cause the Lawes and Statutes of this his Realme, concerning mault &amp; Maultsters, and concerning the assize and price of beere to be put in due execution, and by all meanes to diminsh the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Maultsters, and to establish good Orders to such as they shall allow still to mault for the sparing of Barley, as much as may be, As also to see that common Bruers, Alehouse keepers, and all others that sell Ale or Beere, make their Beere and Ale not too strong, but of such rate and price, as may occasion least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of mault, and whereby they may vtter their Beere at lowe and reasonable prices, that the poorer sort may haue the greater proportion for their money.</p>
               <p>And his Maiestie doth likewise straitly charge and commaund all Maultsters, common Bruers, Alehouse keepers, and such as sell Beere or Ale, to obserue and keepe aswell the Lawes and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realme in that behalfe made, as his Maiesties sayd orders lately published, and all other Orders and directions of the sayd Iustices of peace, Maiors, Bailiffes and other Officers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be made, according to his Maiesties gracious comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in this Proclamation conteined.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation for preseruation of Woods.</head>
               <p>FOrasmuch as by a late view and Suruey had and made of the most part of our Woods in diuers Counties of this Realme, It is certified vnto vs that great spoiles and deua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations are committed, both within our Forrests, Chaces, Parks and Wasts, not onely by bordering Inhabitants, but euen by Woodwards, Keepers, and other of our owne inferiour Officers, such as ought to haue had the chiefe care of the preseruation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and also in and vpon our Mannours, Lordships and demesne Lands, by Tenants, Bailiffes and Reeues, by their vniust ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and improuident assigning Timber trees and Woods, farre beyond all reasonable proportion of allowance: And forasmuch
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:177081:103"/> also as diuers apparant abuses, are likewise committed in the said places by sundry sinister practises to decay our said Woods, and to make them Windfals and pretended Fees; the continuance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath bene so long and dangerous, as without present reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is like suddenly to follow such want of Timber and Wood, as by no future prouidence can be in meete time supplied; Forasmuch as we out of our desire to preserue and increase our Woods, of our Princely care haue hitherto forborne to draw any benefit to our selues by sale thereof, And also for that we find, that by the practises aforesayd, and other the like, our sayd Woods are dayly more wasted, spoiled, and defaced, then if wee did make an yeerely competent Reuenue of the same: We therefore (as respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the good of our posterities, as our owne) haue endeuoured to take course to stop the sayd abuses, and all others too long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, and to worke the meanes not onely of better preseruation of our sayd Woods in times to come, but also of a present multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and increase of Timber and Wood to all future ages. And to the end that our care may appeare to extend to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and increase of timber, aswell in generall to others, as to our selues, We haue thought meet by this our Proclamation, not onely to diuulge our speciall pleasure touching our owne woods, But also strictly to command and charge all our louing Subiects in generall, That in their owne woods they presume not hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to defraud the true meaning of our Statutes in those cases prouided, by cutting and falling the yong storers, when they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fell their Vnderwoods, which the Statute intended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be altogether preserued for Timber: Wherein if they shall be found to offend, they are to expect no fauour, as doing an apparant wrong to the Common wealth, besides the breach of Law, and our Royall commandement.</p>
               <p>And wee doe also straitly command all our louing Subiects, That for auoyding of future spoiles, they nor any of them presume from henceforth to commit any Act, vnder whatsoeuer colour or pretence, not warranted by the true intent of our Lawes, or the Grants made vnto them, whereby our sayd Woods may be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, defaced or abused. And further, that neither our Keepers of Walkes, or Rangers, or other Officer or Officers whatsoeuer, in Forrests, Chaces or Parks, doe vnder colour of browse for our Deere, Feewood or fuell for themselues, or other pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, presume to cut or take more then shall necessarily suffice, without wastefull expence or colourable sale; Neither that they nor any of them, nor any other Subiect whatsoeuer, aduenture to head or shred any Timber tree or trees, but to take onely such
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177081:103"/> lops for browse, as the trees which haue bene vsually lopped shall affoord, and that not in greater proportion then is meete and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. And that no inhabitant in or neere any of our Forrests, Chaces or Wasts, cut off the head or principall branches, or spall out, chip, barke or girt the bodies of any timber tree, or likely to proue timber tree, nor to cut or take any yong saplings of Oake, Elme, Ashe, Beech, or any other tree likely to proue timber, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any of our sayd Forrests, Chaces or Wasts, nor to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of our Coppises or Vnderwoods, to cut, spoyle or waste the same vnder any pretence or colour, except it be for necessary vses, and the same lawfully warranted. And that no Tenant of any our Honors, Mannors, Lordships or Lands, Lessee or Copihol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doe take any timber for Building, or decaying tree for their fuell, nor any Steward, Bailiffe, Reeue, or other Officer, doe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe any tree or trees for any vse, but that hee and they see good warrant from our Treasourer or Chanceller of our Exchequer, or Duchie respectiuely, except in smal reparations which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire haste, Or such as may be amended with an allowance of a tree, two, three or foure at the most. In which cases the Suruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the Woods of that County, or Steward of the Mannour, or three of the better sort of the Tenants of the sayd Mannour, dwelling in or neere the same, shall and may view and consider of the cause of the said reparation or allowance, and allot vnto them supply without such vnlawfull practises of fauour or partialitie, as haue bene too common and frequent. Vnto which view and allowance, if it be made by the sayd Surueyour of the woods, or Steward of the Mannour, some three of the better sort of the sayd Tenants, if there be so many, or foure, where there be not so many, shalbe also made parties and acquainted therewith, And thereupon such allowance being from time to time by such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or assignement made, we doe straitly charge and commaund the same to be at the next Court of the sayd Mannour by the sayd Tenants presented vpon their Oathes, that shall so view the said wants, or shall be acquainted with the same, Setting downe in writing what and how many trees haue beene deliuered, vpon what land, to whom, and to what vses, and specially by what warrant. And whether the same were necessary or not, the same to be done truely and without partialitie, as they will answere the contrary.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, whereas for the better maintenance and present supply of the especiall wants of our Nauie, wee haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and authorized our Officers of the same, by some skilfull and expert persons by them to be chosen sor that purpose, to elect
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:177081:104"/> and make choice in euery of our Counties assigned for present sale all such timber and trees, as by the commissions to them directed, and the seuerall articles therein contained, shall be thought fit to be reserued for the especiall vse of our sayd Nauie, and the same to marke for that purpose; We doe now likewise by these presents straitly charge and command, aswel all our seuerall officers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our seuerall Forrests, Parkes, Chaces, Mannours and lands, as all other our louing Subiects to whome in any sort it may appertaine, that neither they nor any of them, doe at any time hereafter cut or lop, or suffer to be cut or lopped, any trees appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and marked by our sayd Officers, or any of them, to and for the vse of our Nauie, for any other vse whatsoeuer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Warrant that shall bee produced or pretended for the same, except the same Warrant bee signed with our owne Royall hand.</p>

In which respect, although his Maiestie is not ignorant, that by the rule of Law no time can preiudice the Rights of the Kings of this Realme, but that contrarywise, the continuance of time is sayd in Law rather to increase, and aggrauate the wrong, then to extenuate or purge the same; And that in many cases betweene Subiect and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect (by common experience) ancient possessions are euicted and ouerthrowen by titles more ancient: Yet such is his highnes disposition, as he is willing to make them finde, both the effects of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:177081:106"/> his bountie and grace, and the due measure of his integritie and conscience. And therefore being enformed by his Maiesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners and Officers, (employed aswell ordinarily, as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, in the care of his Reuenues) That the possessions of his Subiects, haue, and doe dayly fall within the danger of Law (aswell concerning their Lands of Inheritance, as their Leases from his Maiestie or his Progenitors for liues or yeeres) by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes and meanes; Not onely vpon points of defect in forme, but euen in points of substance most iust and weightie; As in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of exchanges with the Crowne, not duely conueyed or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Subiects part; Of the falsitie of considerations mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, vpon which the Letters Patents haue bene obteined; Of the falsitie of suggestions, whereby the King hath bene deceiued, and sometimes ancient Crowne Lands haue bene caried away, as if they had bene but new augmentations of Reuenues by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, or the like; Of Intailes made to the Kings of this Realme, or descended to them from their Ancesters, whereby it appeareth, that the King hath not bene truely enformed of his estate, when he made his grant, hauing no intention of disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Issue in Taile, against the Law; Of referring to other Letters Patents, where many times there are none such, as by the recitall are supposed; Of insufficient sauing, or prouiding for that estate or benefite, which is intended to the King vpon the Letters Patents, by way of Exception, Reseruation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; Of want of proper and apt words, such as the Law doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, euen in a case betweene Subiect and Subiect; Of passing their Grants vnder a wrong Seale, contrary to the grounds of Law, or expresse Acts of Parliament; Of want of Offices, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie of Offices, whereby the Kings Title not rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, his Grants could not but passe in darkenesse; And many other the like defects in matter and substance, besides the defects, errours, omissions, and misprisions in writing &amp; in forme, which are no lesse dangerous in strictnesse of Law: And his Maiesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further enformed, That the possessions of his louing subiects may also be impeached and brought in question vpon other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles not hauing any dependance vpon defectiue letters Patents, but vpon other points of diuers natures, and yet all warranted by the Lawes of this Land; As vpon Escheats by Attaindors or otherwise, vpon Title accrued by Dissolution, Surrender, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or relinquishing of Monasteries, encrochments vpon his Maiesties Wastes and high wayes, which is a meere vsurpation and intrusion vpon his Maiesties possession, not coloured by any pretence of Title; Vpon occupation of drowned land by time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered

               <p>And as his Maiestie hath heretofore suspended the rigour of a Legall prosecution in these cases, and turned it into a gracious composition, vpon a summary consideration of the title, whereby both the charge of Suit, and the extremitie of Euiction mought bee auoided: So his Highnesse vnderstanding, that euen that course of fauour doth not answere or attaine (in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) to that measure of grace, which he intendeth to his louing Subiects; Is pleased, that there be a cessation also of that former proceeding. And therefore although his Maiestie knowes, that no ordinary forme of Legall proceeding, concludes the interest, nor time extinguisheth the right of Soueraigne Princes, that many prerogatiues assist him, that the voyce of the Lawes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the best to be taken for him, and that hee hath all aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, sauing a heart that will take no aduantage: And although the present necessitie of his estate (whereof the splendor and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is so enlarged) may iustly perswade any lawfull improoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the profits of the Crowne; Yet it hath pleased him, as a pledge of greater fauour intended towards his Subiects, then euer they receiued from his Predecessors, (setting apart all other considerations of profit to himselfe, or power ouer his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in this kinde) by this Proclamation to declare, that he is fully resolued, that all his louing Subiects shall partake of this grace, to haue all the states of their lands confirmed and made perfect, and to be discharged of all meane profits and issues what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer heretofore due or incurred, notwithstanding any of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or imperfections before mentioned, or any other whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; So as their estates bee not by time expired and determined before, as in case of Intailes already spent and runne out: In which case the deteining of any Land from his Maiestie is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, as no priuate man could willingly endure to be so defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For which grace and fauour, as the Subiect shall be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged for euer hereafter, then by payment of fiue yeeres Fine at the vttermost, according to the old Rent, and the same to be Rated onely as it appeareth to be in value by former Office, by particuler, or els by Oath or <hi>Affidauit,</hi> before some Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

For the perfit accomplishment of which his Maiesties gracious intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards his louing Subiects, thus expressed by this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Highnesse is pleased by his Commission vnder the great Seale of England, to giue full and absolute power and authority to certaine selected Commissioners of his Maiesties priuy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and others, to giue order and warrant for such Gifts, Grants, Confirmations, and other Assurances to be made and passed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seale of England, or Seale of the Duchie of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, or by Fines to be leuied, or by all or any other those wayes and meanes as shalbe found needfull and requisit for the seuerall Cases, And as by the Counsaile learned of the parties that shall desire such assurances respectiuely, vpon conference with his Maiesties learned Counsaile shall be thought fit and reasonable. And for their better and more absolute Assurance against all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doubts or questions whatsoeuer, his Maiestie doeth by these presents publish and declare, that he is so willing to confirme and establish their estates, and possessions against all Claimes, Titles and exceptions whatsoeuer, that he is pleased that it be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the next Parliament, That such Gifts, Grants, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Assurances as shalbe made in performance and execution of this his Princely intention, may be ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed against him, his heires and successors for euer, by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Parliament; And also to giue his Royall assent thereunto, when they shalbe brought to that point: And doeth likewise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promise to giue to any his louing Subiects (that shall seeke it) his Royall couenant to be inserted into the Bookes of their Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the effect aforesaid. And for the ease of charge to the Subiect in passing such their Assurances; It hath pleased his Highnesse aswell to giue order that there shalbe an abatement of the ordinary Fees payed at the Seales, as also to permit diuers persons to ioyne in one Patent, til their seuerall purchases doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to fortie Pounds according to the old Rent, whereupon
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:177081:107"/> the Composition shalbe grounded. And because the said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners being most of them of his Maiesties Priuy Counsel, (and therefore ordinarily imployed in the greatest affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) shall not haue so fit meanes at all times to receiue &amp; heare the first motions of his Maiesties Subiects, that shall desire such new assurances as aforesaid; His highnes hath therefore appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Atturney and Sollicitor generall, to be ready from time to time to heare and conferre with his Subiects and their. Counsell concerning the premisses, that they may bee sure to receiue their dispatch with all possible expedition and fauour.</p>

               <p>Whereas wee haue bene contented since our comming to the Crowne, to tolerate an indifferent and promiscuous kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to all our friends whatsoeuer, to fish within our streames, and vpon any of our coasts of Great Britaine, Ireland, and other adiacent Islands, so farre foorth as the permission or vse thereof might not redound to the empeachment of our Prerogatiue Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor to the hurt and damage of our louing Subiects, whose preseruation and flourishing estate we hold our selfe principally bound to aduance before all worldly respects: So finding that our conniuence therein, hath not onely giuen occasion of ouer great encrochments vpon our Regalities, or rather questioning
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:177081:108"/> for our Right, but hath bene a meanes of much dayly wrongs to our owne people that exercise the trade of Fishing, as (either by the multitude of Strangers, which doe preoccupy those places, or by the iniuries which they receiue most cÅmonly at their hands) our Subiects are constrained to abandon their Fishing, or at the least are become so discouraged in the same, as they hold it better for them, to betake themselues to some other course of liuing, whereby not onely diuers of our Coast-townes are much decayed, but the number of Mariners dayly diminished, which is a matter of great consequence to our Estate, considering how much the strength thereof consisteth in the power of Shipping, and vse of Nauigation: We haue thought it now both iust and necessary (in respect that wee are now by Gods fauour lineally and lawfully possessed, aswell of the Island of Great Britaine, as of Ireland, and the rest of the Isles adiacent) to bethinke our selues of good lawfull meanes to preuent those inconueniences, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers depending vpon the same.

Whereas we haue alwayes held it one of the most iust and necessary cares and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations incident to the State and Office of Kings and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, so to dispose of their people and gouernment, as the knowledge and vse of good and profitable Arts and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may become common and frequent amongst their people, the same being one of the greatest meanes to increase and preserue the wealth and strength of State and people, Considering how contrary effects labour and idlenesse doe produce, the one making Kingdomes great and flourishing, the other alwayes bearing the markes of beggery and contempt: Forsomuch as some of our good and louing Subiects of our Realme of England, haue of late to their great charge, and no lesse commendation, found out and made proofe of sundry <hi>Mines</hi> in our Countie of Yorke, for the making of <hi>Allome,</hi> a Merchandize of great necessity and vse sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wayes for all our Dominions, and haue so well and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably proceeded therein, that they are at this time able to make sufficient store of <hi>Allome,</hi> not onely to serue for the vse and expense of all our sayd Kingdomes, but also within short space to affoord and spare great quantities thereof, to be euery yeere transported for the vse and seruice of other our neighbour Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And whereas the sayd persons, who by their skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:177081:112"/> haue effected so good and great a worke, (so often failing vpon other attempts) haue willingly and freely offered and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp the sayd <hi>Allome Mines</hi> into our hands, vpon such Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as haue giuen them full contentment and satisfaction, all men being able to iudge that a matter of that consequence, and wherein so many of our people should bee interessed, was more fit for vs to take into our owne hands, then to leaue the same in the power of priuate men: We haue now thought fit for the sayd considerations, and many other, to giue order to our Treasourer of England, and our Chancellour of our Exchequer, to take the whole worke into our possession, and for that purpose haue made choise of two of the same persons, that managed the same workes before (being both of trust, skill and experience) to deale for vs, as our generall and speciall Factors and Agents, for the whole orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the said works in time to come. And albeit that by meanes of the <hi>Allome</hi> made and to be made within our sayd Realme, wee shall receiue great hinderance by being depriued of such Customes and other dueties, as formerly haue beene vsually payd vnto vs and our Predecessours Kings and Princes of this our Realme, for and vpon that Commoditie imported: Yet to the intent our Subiects shall not bee any way wronged, but in all points care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully respected and duely prouided for in that Commoditie, Wee haue (out of our Royall and tender care of our Subiects good) giuen expresse order and commandement, that our sayd Agents shall prouide and cause to be prouided, and at all times, and from time to time hereafter haue in their custodie, in some fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient Store-houses, both within the Citie of London, and within euery other Citie and port Towne of the same our Realm of England, as shalbe thought fit and appointed, sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of <hi>Allome,</hi> and that from the sayd Store-houses, all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery our people and Subiects shall and may from time to time, buy and haue thereof by lesser or greater quantities at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, so much good and seruiceable <hi>Allome,</hi> as they or any of them shall at any time require, and at such rate and price to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently appoynted to bee payd for and vpon euery hundred weight of <hi>Allome</hi> so to be sold and deliuered as aforesayd, as shall not giue any iust cause of discontent to any of our louing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>

               <p>WE had hoped, seeing it is notorious to all our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, how greatly we delight in the exercise of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, aswell for our recreation, as for the necessary preseruation of our health, that no man in whom was either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:177081:113"/> to our person, or feare of our Lawes, would haue offered vs offence in those our sports, considering especially, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all people is not onely in things of this qualitie, but in matters of greater moment so farre to conforme themselues to the affections and disposition of their Soueraigne, as to affect that which they know to be liking to them and to respect it, and to auoyd the contrary: And wee must acknowledge that we haue found, that Gentlemen and persons of the better sort (who know best what becommeth their duetie) haue restrained their owne humors, and framed themselues therein to giue vs contentment: yet falleth it out notwithstanding, that neither the example of them, nor respect of the Lawes, nor duety to vs, hath had power to reforme the corrupt natures and insolent dispositions of some of the baser sort, and some other of a disordered life; By diuers of which condition (since our offence manifested against those that trespasse in that kinde) and since our last comming forth into this Progresse, in places where wee lately tooke our pleasure in our owne grounds, and neere our owne houses of abode, there haue bene more frequent offences offered in that kinde, then at any time heretofore, or in the late Queenes dayes were attempted: Neuerthelesse, howsoeuer in her later dayes (being a Lady whose sexe and yeeres were not so apt to that kinde of recreation, hauing no posteritie, and therefore lesse carefull of conseruation of that kinde of Royaltie, which her progenitors Kings of this Realme had mainteined) people might perhaps for those respects presume of more libertie then became them, or the Lawes of the Realme doe permit; Yet in our time, being a Prince that haue manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted our afftction and delight in that exercise, and hauing posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie like to continue in the same disposition, when either their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation or their exercise shall require it; It seemeth strange that men will now attempt to offend with more licentiousnesse, then at any time heretofore, and offer to vs in our grounds, that which they will not endure each at others hands in their owne. Wee are not ignorant, that there are some passions in mens mindes so strong, as hard it is but they will breake foorth at times beyond the bounds of reason, where commoditie, pleasure or reuenge prouoketh: But this offence being a trespassing against reason which hath no end in it, whereof can redound to the offender ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profit or pleasure, honour or other recompense; We cannot interprete that the transgressions that are done therein doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but either out of a barbarous and vnciuill disposition, not fit to bee suffered in an ordered Estate, or out of an insolent humor and vnrespectiue to our person, no wayes to be endured. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:177081:114"/> that we haue manifested our Princely disposition to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Iustice, and giuen as free and liberall scope to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Lawes of this Realme, as euer did any of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, We cannot but wonder that men should conceiue that in these kinds of trespasses being so offensiue to vs, we would not be iust to our selfe and right the wrongs and insolencies offered to vs, in so speciall a branch of our Prerogatiue, where the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, both Ancient and Moderne, doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord vs so full and strong remedies, as appeares by the Charter of our Forrest, as ancient and authenticall, as the great Charter of the Lawes of the Realme, and by other Lawes and Statutes, some inforcing the Offendors (besides other grieuous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fine and imprisonment) to abiure the Realme, some punishing them with death, as iudging them vnworthy to liue, at least in this well ordered Kingdome, that cannot bridle so inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate an humor, which reigning with so great violence in one excesse, will passe on (if it be not checked) to all other extremities. Being therefore thus deepely prouoked, and minding to vse as strait and as seuere meanes for the preseruation of our right, and punishing of offendors in these cases, as the Lawes of our Realme will affoord; Wee haue bene pleased notwithstanding out of our gracious disposition, to forewarne men of our purpose, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to them the seueritie we intend to vse hereafter, for redresse of such enormities, knowing that such warning wil either restraine them from giuing vs offence, or (if their vnduetifull humor can be reformed by no admonition) make them the more inexcusable to vs and our Lawes for their punishment. And therefore we doe hereby signifie to all men, that after the publishing of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, our meaning is to proceed in this maner against all Hunters, Stealers, and killers of Deere, either Red or Fallow, within any our Forrests, Chases, or Parkes.</p>
               <p>First, to extend against them all penalties whatsoeuer, which by the Lawes of the Forrests, or by any other Lawes or statutes of the Realme are to be inflicted vpon them. To giue a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to all such as shall informe vs, or our Iustices of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, or any Lieutenant, or any other hauing charge of any our Forrests, Parks, or Chaces, of any offendors in hunting, stealing or killing of our Deere by any vnlawfull wayes. And if the fault be found in any of our Seruants, or any towards our Court, or person of quality, he shalbe assured not onely to loose our fauour, but to be debarred of our presence, or resort to our Court. And if it appeare that none of those penalties shall haue power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine insolent mindes from committing outrages so wilful and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:177081:114"/> vnreasonable: We will make no doubt but that our Parliament finding the Lawes now in force too weake to roote out such an euil, will assist vs with their aduise, to prouide some further and more sufficient remedies for that purpose, wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed aswell as we: for they that dare presume vpon vs wil not spare them. But our hope is, that our Subiects, knowing now againe the offence we take at these insolencies, and being warned of our intent, will not giue vs cause to exercise the least of these penalties, which we shall be glad to finde, aswell to see the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of our peoples minds to our disposition, as for the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of our Nature, vnwilling to haue any cause of punishment against the least of them, especially in matter concerning our selfe.</p>

And his Highnesse further pleasure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is, That all Sheriffes shall returne their Writs and Proces against all such Accomptants and Debtors, at the dayes therein appointed. And if any person or persons, who ought to accompt or pay any summe or summes of money to his Maiestie
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:177081:115"/> in any of the Courts and places aforesaid, doe make default there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, That then his Highnesse Writs and Proces shall be awarded and sent foorth against euery such person and persons, and the same to be duely &amp; orderly serued, and returned by the Sheriffes and Officers thereunto appoynted, in such like maner and forme, as the same should haue beene, if this present Proclamation had not bene made. And if any Sheriffe or other Officer shall make default, or be negligent in seruing, executing, or returning of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Writs and Proces aforesayd, That then euery such She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe and other Officer, shall incurre such paines and penalties, as by the sayd Courts, or any of them shall be taxed and assessed; Willing and commanding all and euery his Maiesties Sheriffes, Officers, Ministers and Subiects, to whome it doth or shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, to obserue and keepe their assemblies and apparances with all their Returnes and Certificates, in his Highnesse sayd Courts at Westminster, in <hi>Mense MichaÃ«lis</hi> next comming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to doe their Offices and dueties in euery behalfe, in like maner and forme, as they should or ought to haue done, if this present Proclamation had not bene had or made, as they will answere to the contrary at their perils.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation inhibiting the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Pepper from forraine parts, by any other persons then those of the East Indian Company.</head>
               <p>FOrasmuch as it is not vnknowen, That in former times when all or the greatest part of Pepper, and other Spices of the grouth of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> was brought into this our Realme of England and Principalitie of Wales by strangers onely the same was then sold at very high Rates, vntil such time as some of our owne Merchants did themselues trade into those parts, and bringing in good quantities of those Commodities, did sell the same at much lower prices, to the great reliefe and benefit of all our Subiects in generall: And forasmuch as wee doe finde, That the establishment and continuance of this Trade, hath and will bee more and more an occasion to imploy and encrease the great Shipping of this Kingdome, which hath heretofore bene out of vse, as being not so necessary for Trade in Countreys that are not so farre remote: For these, and some other reasons which haue bene deliuered vnto vs, being desirous to encourage this Company, and to maintaine that Trade by all good and lawfull meanes; And experience teaching vs, That if there should be, till the Trade were better setled, a free and generall libertie for all persons whatsoeuer to bring in those Commodities, it would be an occasion to ouerlay the Trade, and strangers would of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vent their Spices at smal rates, thereby to enforce our owne Subiects to desist from trading into those Countreys: We with the aduise of our Priuie Councell, haue thought fit, for some time to restraine the Importation of Pepper from forraine parts, by any others then by the merchants ioyntly of the <hi>East Indian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And therefore we doe hereby will and command all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and persons whatsoeuer, either our natural borne Subiects, Denizens, or Strangers (not being the Company aforesaid) to forbeare to bring into these our Dominions of England and Wales, any Pepper, directly or indirectly, vpon paine of forfeiture of the goods, and what other punishment they may incurre by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contempt and default herein. And to the end, this our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure may be more duely obserued, Wee doe likewise charge and command all Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, Farmours of our Customes and their Deputies, and all other our Officers of the Ports, within our Territories aforesaid, That
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:177081:117"/> they doe not giue any Bills of Entrie for Pepper that is brought in from forraine Countreyes, by any other then those who shalbe knowen to be of the Company aforesaid: Neither shall they suffer it to be landed, or being so, shall seize the same to our vse as iustly forfaited. And moreouer, they and euery of them, shall vse their best meanes and endeuours to hinder and preuent all secret and fraudulent practizes of such as shall seeke to bring in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, Notwithstanding this our pleasure published to the contrary.</p>
               <p>ANd because we are carefull to preuent all inconueniences to the generalitie of our Subiects, in case they should be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with vnder this restraint, by those that haue the whole masse of Pepper in their owne handes; Although wee hold the Company to be compounded of many good &amp; honest Merchants and others, yet because there is no Societie wherein all are of one temper, And out of the care we haue alwayes had for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of all our people more then of any particuler Society; we thought it not safe to repose so much confidence in a part of our people, as to leaue the whole body subiect to their wills, in matter of this nature. And therefore hauing well examined what might bee an indifferent price to yeeld to the Merchants competent gaine for the maintenance of so great &amp; long a Trade, and so needfull for the support of Nauigation, and yet not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeable to the rest of our people, who haue on the other side dayly vse of that kinde of Spice; Wee haue conditioned with them, and limitted, That they shall vtter Pepper at the rate of two shillings sixe pence the pound, and not exceeed, to any that shall come or send for it, vpon paine of our high displeasure.</p>
               <p>Which prouision, and limitation being made by vs in fauour of the communitie of our Subiects, we haue thought good to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and make knowen to all men, To the ende that if it fall out, that such as by way of Retaile doe vtter to our people dwelling in places remote from our Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and other parts where Shipping doeth ariue, that kinde of Spice, there bee exacted any prices excessiue, it may appeare that the same is not for want of due prouision made to preuent it, but by the ouergreedinesse of those which shall sell it. In which consideration, although we know, that there are many reasons, why those that sell by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, should demaund a further price then they pay for it here, as well in respect of the distance of place, forbearing of their money, as many other things incident to that kinde of Trade: Yet the better to containe them within the bounds of reasonable gaine, we haue thought good to make knowen thus much, thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:177081:117"/> our owne care of our louing Subiects, and to shew them the meanes whereby they may auoyde such further burden, as may be cast vpon them by any that shall goe about by any vndue practise, to raise immoderate gaine, vnder colour or pretext of that course which we haue taken for the reasons aforesaid.</p>

               <head>Â¶ A Proclamation forbidding the making of Starch.</head>
               <p>FOrsomuch as in the time of the late dearth and scarcitie of Corne and Graine within this our Realme of England and Dominion of Wales, We hauing receiued Certificats from sundry parts and places of this Realme, that great quantities of Wheate and other stuffe, fit and wholesome for the food and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance of our louing Subiects, being daily in great abundance spent and consumed in making of Starch, were a great meane to continue the sayd dearth and scarcitie; And that the making thereof into Starch in places vnfit for that purpose, was also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noysome vnto the Inhabitants neere adioyning; Whereupon, out of that tender care which we haue alwayes had of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects welfare, for remedy of the same, and of all inconueniences thereby incident, We were then pleased, to cause our Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be published, and by the same did will and command, That the making of Starch of any kinde of stuffe whatsoeuer, should be suppressed in all parts of our said Realme and Dominion; Onely giuing thereby some small tolleration, that some few selected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, dwelling neere our Cities of London &amp; Westminster, should be suffered to spend and worke out into Starch, certaine small quantities of Wheate, which hauing taken wet at Sea, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come musty, vnsauoury, and vnwholesome, and altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for our sayd Subiects food, and were affirmed to bee at that time lying vnsold, and decaying, on the hands of such merchants, as had formerly brought in the same from forreine Countreys, As by our sayd Proclamation may more at large appeare.</p>
               <p>And whereas wee are now againe enformed by the credible Certificats of seuerall Iustices of Peace of sundry of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and chiefe Magistrates and Officers of Cities and Townes Corporate, That out of the same our small tolleration (tending
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:177081:118"/> rather to the benefite of the sayd Merchants, then to the increase or encouragement of Starchmaking) a farre greater number of persons, euen in all parts and places of the same our Realme and Dominion, euer since that time haue, and daily more and more do set vp and begin Starch-making in sundry places noysome and inconuenient, and that in the same they do cÅsume greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Wheat, rubbles of wheat, Pollard, and other stuffe fit for our Subiects food, then at any time before the publishing of our said Proclamation, And that the sayd Starch is altogether made directly of Wheat, and other stuffe fit for mans food, And that the making thereof cannot be continued within this Realme, but that the same wil be a great meanes to helpe and further the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of dearth and scarcitie within the same, to the great and intollerable dammage of the Common wealth; And that likewise the making thereof in places procuring such noysomnesse, may be one great cause to continue that dangerous Infection of the Plague, which hath (to our great griefe) bene generally dispersed amongst our people of late yeeres, by meanes of the same; And that it is no way beneficiall to the Common wealth, but a thing of late time inuented, and may more properly be termed matter of vanitie, and pride, as it is vsed by inferiour persons, then of any necessitie: And therefore, to the ende it shall appeare, as well in this, as it hath done in all other our Actions since our comming vnto this Kingdome, what care wee alwayes haue of the health, welfare and profit of our louing Subiects; And how much wee preferre any cause importing their good, before any gaine or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to our selfe, And that we rather desire, that all such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as by the voluntary contributions of the makers of Starch within our Realmes, did formerly, and would still haue accrued, and become due and payable vnto vs, our heires and Successors, by meanes of the same Toleration giuen vnto them, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd, should bee forborne and vtterly lost, then that our people should alwayes be subiect to such, and so many euils and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, occasioned as aforesayd, or our Priuie Counsell trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with so many and often complaints against a thing offensiue so many wayes, besides that which is of greatest consequence, which is, the consuming of that which ought to bee respected for the food of man.</p>
               <p>And therefore, hauing with the aduice of our Counsell concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and seriously resolued, that it is very requisite, for the causes afore mentioned, absolutely to suppresse, and vtterly to abolish the making of Starch in all places of our sayd Realme and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;

And also that they and euery of them doe, and shall from and after the tenth day of the moneth of March next after the date hereof; absolutely surcease, and for euer vtterly forbeare and giue ouer to make or cause to be made, dressed, dryed, and prepared any Starch at all of any kinde of stuffe or stuffes, by what name or title, names or titles soeuer the same or any of them are, or may be called, in any place or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatsoeuer within our sayd Realme and Dominion. And if any person or persons shall presume or attempt to doe contrary to our expresse pleasure and commandement before declared, We doe let them know by these presents, That he or they so offending, shall not onely forfeit and loose all the Starch by them so made, and all and singuler their Tubs, Vessels and instruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they or any of them doe and shall so make, or cause the same Starch to be made contrary to our will and pleasure signified as aforesayd, The one halfe of all which forfeitures shall bee, and Wee doe by these presents giue and graunt vnto the partie fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out and seizing the same, and the other halfe thereof to Vs, our heires and successours, but that wee intend and are fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to proceede against all such Offenders with all seueritie to the due punishment of the same their contempts of our Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue

               <p>Wherefore wee doe by these presents straitly charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all and singuler Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and other our Subiects whatsoeuer, that (albeit they haue much neglected our other Proclamations in this behalfe) they doe now carefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently see and take order, that our Pleasure declared in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents bee from hencefoorth in euery point fully obserued and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully obeyed, and that neither they nor any of them doe, or shall suffer any person or persons within their seuerall precincts to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, or doe any thing in this behalfe contrary to the Tenour of this our Proclamation, vpon paine of incurring such penalties and punishments to bee at our will and pleasure inflicted vpon them or any of them, being found negligent as aforesayd, as shall be thought requisite and due for their deserts.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, for that it shall appeare that our purpose herein is not that the better sort of our saide Subiects should bee altogether depriued of the necessary vse of Starch, and to the end the price and value of Starch may not by this meanes in any sort be raised or augmented, But that the same may at all times hereafter bee solde and vented at as cheape and reasonable rates, as at any time heretofore whiles the same was permitted to bee made within our saide Realme and Dominions; Wee haue also thought good to signifie and declare by these Presents; That from and after the publication hereof, it shall and may bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to and for all manner of person and persons whatsoeuer, to transport and bring, and cause to bee brought from any forreine parts or places whatsoeuer (being with vs in league and amitie) into any the Ports and places of the same our Realme and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, such quantitie and quantities of Starch as to them or any of them shall seeme most meete, And (hauing payed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered vnto our Collectours and other Officers of our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, all and singuler such summe and summes of Money, and other dueties as at the time of publication of this our Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and from thencefoorth are and shall bee due vnto vs, our Heires and Successors, for and vpon the same) to vent and make sale of the same Starch in any place or places of the same our Dominion, to their best benefite and aduantage, as heretofore hath bene accustomed.
